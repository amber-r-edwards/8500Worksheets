INTTERNAnONAL  FEMINISM 


Quest  Communique 


Because  of  the  magnitude  of  the  subject  this  will  be  a  special  112  page 
issue.  Next  issue  it  will  be  back  to  our  new,  but  now  regular,  96  page 
format. 

Explanation  of  Schedule 

Your  subscription  is  not  messed  up  and  the  post  office  is  not  carrying 
out  a  subversive  plot  to  undermine  the  women's  movement.  Quest  is 
behind  in  our  publishing  schedule.  You  should  have  received  Vol.  IV, 
No.  1,  "Kaleidoscope  Two,"  in  late  December,  1977.  It  was  indeed, 
dated  Summer,  1977.  However,  this  issue,  Vol.  IV,  No.  2,  which  is  the 
issue  succeeding  Kaleidoscope  Two,  is  dated  Winter,  1978.  Henceforth, 
we  will  date  the  issue  with  the  season  in  which  it  is  actually  published. 

In  the  past,  we  have  tied  ourselves  to  a  schedule  of  seasons  corres- 
ponding to  volume  and  issue  numbers.  This  became  totally  confusing 
with  the  last  issue  because  it  was  so  far  behind  schedule.  This  does  not 
mean,  however,  that  we  are  becoming  a  less-than-quarterly  publication. 
In  fact,  to  retain  our  second  class  mailing  rates  (which  represent  incredi- 
ble savings)  we  must  publish  four  times  a  year.  That  is  why  we  will  still 
be  catching  up  on  our  schedule  over  the  next  four  issues. 

Besides  time,  the  biggest  hurdle  we  face  is  money.  In  order  to  put  out 
more  than  one  issue  in  three  months,  we  have  to  create  more  income  to 
pay  for  the  additional  typesetting  and  printing.  Catching  up,  therefore, 
becomes  a  problem  of  finances  as  much  as  of  time.  That  is  the  dilemma 
we're  in  right  now:  we  have  another  issue  ready  to  go  to  the  printer,  but 
we  don't  have  the  money  to  pay  our  already  high  printing  debt  so  that  it 
can  go  to  press. 

We  must  publish  three  more  issues  before  October,  1978,  in  order  to 
keep  our  second  class  rates.  That's  four  issues  in  approximately  nine 
months,  or,  funds  for  one  more  issue  than  has  been  normal  for  the  same 
time  period.  For  us,  that  means  extra  hard  work  to  meet  the  schedule  and 
raise  the  additional  money.  For  you,  if  we  succeed,  it  means  your  Quests 
will  come  closer  together  this  year,  and  you'll  need  to  renew  your  sub- 
scription sooner  than  you  expect. 

Sustaining  Contributors 

One  way  you  can  help  us  is  by  becoming  a  Sustaining  Contributor. 
We  have  suggested  $25  a  year.  We  welcome  more,  or  less,  as  you  can 
manage.  If  you  have  just  subscribed  or  renewed  your  subscription, 
please  consider  subscribing  for  another  year  and  becoming  a  Sustaining 
Contributor  now,  or  taking  gift  subscriptions  for  your  friends.  Quest  is 
a  non-profit,  tax-exempt  organization,  so  any  amount  contributed 
beyond  the  $9  annual  subscription  is  a  tax  deductible  contribution. 
Thank  you  for  your  continuing  support.

Quest:  a  feminist  quarterly  is  seeking  long-term,  in-depth  feminist  po- 
litical analysis  and  ideological  development.  Quest  is  not  an  end  in  it- 
self, but  a  process  leading  to  new  directions  for  the  women's  move- 
ment, possibly  including  such  concrete  forms  as  regional  or  national 
conferences,  a  national  organization,  or  a  political  party.  We,  the  edi- 
tors, are  all  women  who  have  been  in  the  movement  several  years 
and  have  reached  a  point  where  each  answer  leads  us  to  more  ques- 
tions. We  have  been  through  various  ideological  and  activist  meta- 
morphoses and  end  up  feeling  that  our  overall  perspective  is  still  not 
adequate.  Where  has  the  struggle  brought  us?  Closer  to  real  econom- 
ic, political,  and  social  power  for  women?  Closer  to  the  end  of  the  ex- 
ploitation of  and  violence  against  women?  Closer  to  self-determina- 
tion for  all  women?  We  do  not  have  all  the  answers  ourselves  and  ex- 
pect that  feminists  across  the  country  and  the  world  will  contribute  to 
this  process  of  seeking.

An  Introduction . . . 


By  CHARLOTTE  BUNCH 


In  the  summer  of  1964,  I  made  my 
first  trip  outside  of  North  America.  I 
participated  in  a  work-study  project 
sponsored  by  the  Japanese  YMCA 
where  we  discussed  "Our  Respon- 
sibility in  a  Changing  Asia."  I  was 
one  of  the  few  participating 
Westerners;  half  the  participants 
were  Japanese,  and  most  of  the  others 
were  Asians.  Therefore,  everything 
we  did  and  discussed  was  from  a 
Japanese,  or  at  least  Asian,  perspec- 
tive, and  experiencing  that  difference 
changed  my  life.  At  first  I  was  com- 
pletely disoriented.  Gradually, 
though,  I  learned  that  the  world,  its 
problems,  and  even  how  one  dis- 
cusses them,  look  quite  different 
when  viewed  from  another  culture, 
from  other  countries  and  life 
experiences.  To  say  that  this  is  true, 
however,  and  to  experience  its  truth 
often  are  very  different.  Spending 
time  in  another  country  is  not  the 
only  (or  even  a  guaranteed)  way  to 
come  to  understand  this 
phenomenon;  but  having  to  function 
in  a  completely  different  cultural 
context  can  be  one  of  the  most  effec- 
tive ways  to  learn  this  lesson  —  as  the 
Third  World  Women  who  critique 
US-sponsored  conference  on  Women 
and    Development    note.     (See 


Organizers'  Dialogue:  "A  Critical 
View  of  the  Wellesley  Conference.") 

Since  that  summer,  I  have  travelled 
to  other  places,  met  people  from 
many  other  societies,  and  have  dis- 
covered more  about  the  cultural 
differences  within  this  country  itself 
—  and  I  have  also  learned  a  great  deal 
about  imperialism.  But  still,  I  will 
never  forget  that  shock  and  the 
changes  in  my  perception  of 
"reality"  that  came  with  having  to 
function  in  a  completely  different 
frame  of  reference.  As  a  movement, 
we  feminists  in  the  US  need  to 
experience  that  shock.  We  have 
necessarily  begun  our  analysis  in 
light  of  our  own  experiences,  but  our 
perspectives  have  also  been  limited 
by  that  view.  As  our  movement  and 
its  analysis  have  matured  over  the 
past  few  years,  it  is  particularly  im- 
portant that  we  listen  and  talk  across 
national  boundaries.  This  is  not  an 
easy  task,  and  this  issue  of  Quest 
does  not  claim  to  meet  that  demand. 
But  we  hope  that  for  some  it  will  be 
an  eye-opener  and  for  all  a  significant 
contribution  to  the  difficult  but  es- 
sential process  of  building  a 
sustained  international  feminist 
dialogue. 

When  Quest  began  planning  its 
future  themes  in  1974,  a  special 
"international"  issue  was  proposed. 
We   rejected   the   idea   at   that   time 


4/Quesf,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


because  we  wanted  to  integrate  ar- 
ticles from  all  over  the  world  into 
each  issue  rather  than  segregating 
them  into  one.  We  thought  that  it 
would  not  be  necessary  to  have  a 
special  theme  in  order  to  include 
feminist  perspectives  from  around 
the  world.  We  were  wrong.  In  our 
first  three  years,  we  published  only  a 
few  articles  written  by  women  out- 
side the  US.  We  discovered  that  we 
were  not  able  to  attract  such  articles 
unless  we  made  a  particular  effort  by 
concentrating  an  entire  issue  on 
feminist  perspectives  from  other 
countries. 

When  the  development  committee 
for  this  issue  convened,  our  first 
problem  was  how  to  describe  our  in- 
tent. We  wanted  articles  about 
women's  struggles  toward  the 
development  of  feminism  —  by 
whatever  name  they  called  it.  But  we 
did     not    want    articles    simply 


describing  the  state  of  women's  op- 
pression throughout  the  world 
because  other  publications  are 
already  providing  that  information. 
Yet,  we  realized  that  understanding 
the  context  in  which  ideas  and  ac- 
tions develop  is  integral  to  un- 
derstanding the  feminism  of  other 
countries.  We  also  realized  that  while 
many  women  outside  the  US  are 
forced  to  know  something  about  our 
culture  because  it  is  exported 
everywhere,  not  many  women  in  the 
US  know  much  about  other  coun- 
tries. 

Finally,  we  called  the  issue  "Inter- 
national Feminism"  and  solicited  ar- 
ticles covering  three  major  areas  of 
focus:  (1)  What  kinds  of  feminist  or 
women's  activities,  movements  and 
concerns  are  generated  by  different 
national  and/or  cultural  conditions? 
How  do  these  differ  and  what  —  if 
any  —  seem  to  be  common  themes  in

An  Introduction/5 


women's  concerns  internationally? 
Can  we  talk  about  the  global  oppres- 
sion of  women  —  its  causes  and  cures 
—  in  any  universal  terms?  What 
cross-national  networks  of  women 
are  developing?  (2)  How  do  par- 
ticular governments,  economic  struc- 
tures   and    social    systems    affect 


race  and  class  analyses  important  in- 
ternationally, and  what  is  their 
significance  for  women  in  various 
situations? 

Ambitious  questions,  we  knew, 
but  ones  that  we  hoped  then,  and  still 
hope,  will  provoke  discussion  and 
future  work.  Despite  the  focus  of  our

women's  lives  in  work,  childrearing, 
sex,  etc.?  What  role  do  non- 
governmental forms  of  social 
organization  —  such  as  ethnic,  tribal 
or  religious  groups,  or  trade  unions 
and  political  parties  —  play  in  af- 
fecting women's  lives,  either  in  con- 
flict or  in  cooperation  with  the 
government?  (3)  What  theoretical, 
strategic  and  programmatic 
developments  are  taking  place  that 
are  vital  to  an  international  feminist 
audience?  Why  are  issues  such  as 
"development,"  the  economic  func- 
tion of  women,  lesbian  oppression,  or 


questions,  most  of  the  articles  we 
received  were  about  the  state  of 
women's  oppression  in  various  coun- 
tries. And  many  of  those  were 
written  by  American  and  European 
women  about  Third  World  women. 
We  had  initially  decided  not  to  print 
articles  by  Westerners  about  the 
Third  World  in  order  to  avoid  the 
cultural  bias  and  problems  of  "us" 
writing  about  "them."  Nevertheless, 
many  of  these  articles  were  infor- 
mative, and  through  consideration  of 
this  dilemma,  we  became  aware  of  the 
need    for    the    development    of    a 


6/Quest

political/ethical  perspective  on  how 
and  when  feminists  can  write  with 
integrity  about  women  in  other 
cultures. 

Our  priority  has  been  articles  from 
a  wide  variety  of  countries  discussing 
what  seem  to  be  common  questions 
and  experiences  for  women  —  ones 
which  go  beyond  a  single  country. 
Since  our  emphasis  is  on  fundamen- 
tal feminist  issues,  and  not  on 
specific  activities  or  conditions  rele- 
vant to  single  circumstances,  we  have 
reprinted  some  important  articles 
written  several  years  ago  but  not 
widely  available. 

We  have  learned  a  great  deal  about 
the  problems  of  "internationalism" 
and  about  the  common  questions  that 
feminists  face.  Two  related  themes 
are  most  significant:  First,  all  issues 
are  indeed  feminist  issues,  and  sec- 
ond, a  certain  instinct  for  a  common 
perspective  ties  us  together,  although 
we  do  not  yet  have  an  analysis 
providing  the  cohesive  element.  If 
feminism  is  to  be  perceived  globally 
as  a  viable  concept,  it  must  not  limit 
itself  to  a  narrow  definition  of 
women's  concerns.  Feminism  is  not 
about  a  list  of  issues.  Rather,  it  is 
about  developing  a  particular 
perspective  on  all  matters  which 
touch  on  our  lives.  Women  in 
different  countries  clearly  have 
different  priorities;  but  if  feminism  is 
a  universally  applicable  perspective, 
it  will  provide  a  framework  for  all 
those  concerns,  no  matter  how 
diverse.  And  there  is  among  women  a 
certain  impulse  toward  such  a  com- 
mon feminist  perspective;  its 
existence  in  not  yet  fully  articulated 
terms  is  clear  throughout  the 
manuscripts  we  have  received.  We  do 
not  yet  share  an  analysis  binding  that 


instinct  and  giving  it  form.  We  are 
then,  a  movement  of  many  common 
experiences  and  instincts,  but  one 
which  has  not  yet  given  birth  to  a 
common  language  and  analysis.  Still, 
it  is  the  presence  of  that  impulse 
which  fuels  the  search  for  that  com- 
mon language  and  analysis  and  gives 
us  hope  that,  indeed,  some  form  of 
global  feminist  perspective  is 
developing. 

In  working  on  this  issue,  certain 
questions  kept  recurring:  How  does 
the  feminist  movement  relate  to 
Marxist  or  class  movements  —  both 
in  theory  and  practice?  What  is  the 
role  of  women's  revolution  within 
nationalist  movements?  What  is  the 
significance  for  women  of  what  have 
been  called  "development"  plans  for 
the  non-industrialized  countries? 
What  do  we  consider  signs  of 
progressive  "development"  or  ad- 
vance for  women  in  any  culture? 
How  do  we  respect  the  self- 
determination  of  previously- 
colonized  countries  and  also  ar- 
ticulate our  criticisms  of  anti-woman 
practices  within  them?  How  has  the 
oppression  of  women  in  in- 
dustrialized countries  taken  a  subtle 
and  insidious  turn  which  is 
sometimes  exported  as  "women's 
emancipation",  and  how  can  we  pre- 
vent that  exportation  without  rein- 
forcing the  more  traditional  forms  of 
female  oppression?  And  of  course, 
finally,  what  are  the  origins  of  our 
oppression  in  every  culture,  and  how 
are  they  related:  what  are  strategies 
for  eradicating  sexism,  and  how 
much  can  we  transfer  strategies  from 
one  culture  to  another? 

While  producing  this  issue,  we 
have  experienced  some  of  the  prac- 
tical problems  of  communicating  in- 


An  Introduction/7 


ternationally.  Most  of  us  in  the  US 
are  English-language  chauvinists. 
We  are  not  familiar  with  trying  to  un- 
destand  something  not  written  in  our 
native  tongue,  and  we  are  used  to 
having  access  to  an  abundance  of 
material  in  our  own  language.  We  not 
only  take  language  for  granted,  but 
are  also  cut  off  from  many  important 
feminist  writings  because  we  have 
not  sought  to  read  or  have  translated 
the  feminist  literature  not  available 
in  English.  Reading  material  written 
outside  of  the  US  made  us  aware  of 
how  often  our  own  writing  is  based 
in  American  experience  and  jargon 
that  assumes  it  is  international,  but  is 
in  fact  parochial  and  inaccessible  to 
other  women.  For  these  reasons,  we 
considered  printing  each  article  in 
this  issue  in  its  original  language  and 
leaving  it  to  you,  the  readers,  to  dis- 
cover the  problems  of  translation,  but 
we  decided  the  content  was  too  im- 
portant to  risk  such  an  experiment. 


And  finally,  the  process  of  putting 
this  issue  together  reminded  us  of  the 
tenuous  hold  we  have  over  any  of 
life's  resources,  including  our 
channels  of  communication.  We  are 
utterly  dependent  on  male  inter- 
national systems,  such  as  the  postal 
service,  for  all  forms  of  communica- 
tion. This  dependence  has  caused  us 
problems  and  taught  us  that  patience 
is  essential  in  dealing  on  an  inter- 
national scale. 

This  issue  only  begins  to  touch  the 
areas  that  must  be  explored  before  in- 
ternational feminism  is  a  living  reali- 
ty. Its  purpose  is  to  contribute  to 
awakening  a  greater  concern,  par- 
ticularly among  US  feminists,  for 
exchange  among  women  throughout 
the  world.  Such  an  exchange  must  be 
based  on  seeing  ourselves  as  equals  — 
women  engaged  in  creating  an  inter- 
national dialogue  grounded  in  our 
respect  for  both  our  common  and  our 
differing  experiences.

Can  Feminism  Be  a  Global  Ideology? 


By  DEVAKI  JAIN 

graphics  by  Scarlet  Cheng 


In  international  gatherings,  the 
brown  and  black  women  usually 
bristle  with  animosity  when  the 
women's  liberation  movement  or 
feminism  is  mentioned.  There  is  an 
immediate  rejection  of  the 
philosophy  as  inappropriate,  not 
only  because  of  the  economic 
differences  between  the  West  and 
Asia,  Africa  and  Latin  America,  but 
because  of  the  cultural  differences. 
Feminism  usually  is  seen  as  an  anti- 
male  philosophy  or  a  male- 
mimicking  quest  for  equality  which 
is  unattractive  in  its  perception,  un- 
necessary for  us  and  inappropriate  to 
our  political  economies. 

Is  this  animosity  justified?  What 
are  these  differences  and  do  they 
suggest  a  different  ideology? 

It  is  my  view  that  some  of  this 
rejection  may  be  based  on  mistaken 
notions  of  what  feminism  is  about 
and  the  tendency  to  think  that 
feminism  and  the  women's  liberation 
movement  are  synonymous.  As  I 
perceive  it,  feminism  and  the 
women's  liberation  movement  are  not 
synonymous.  The  essense  of 
feminism  is  a  belief  in  the  separate 
identity  of  the  female. 

Feminists  want  this  separateness  to 
be  moulded  into  a  force  which 
presses  society  to  accept  and  accom- 
modate femaleness  as  equal,  even  if 
different,  in  its  attributes.  Feminists 
also  believe  that  only  women  uniting 


as  women  can  generate  such  a  force 
for  change. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  women's 
liberation  movement  —  which  is  by 
no  means  a  homogeneous  movement 
—  consists  of  many  local  thrusts  and 
pressures  and  accommodates  a  diver- 
sity of  approaches.  Even  women 
belonging  to  the  same  country,  the 
same  village,  strongly  differ  in  their 
approach  to  female  emancipation,  so 
it  is  no  surprise  that  certain  thrusts  of 
the  movement  associated  with  the 
West  are  found  distasteful  in  the 
East. 

Hence,  if  feminism  as  an  ideology 
is  not  totally  identified  with  all  local 
expressions  of  the  women's  liberation 
movement,  there  may  be  less  rejec- 
tion. Let  us  consider  some  il- 
lustrations of  approaches  in  the 
Western  countries  which  appear  in- 
appropriate elsewhere. 

Wages  for  Housework 

Take  the  Wages  for  Housework 
movement  (as  described  in  a  speech 
by  Selma  James  —  who  comes  from  a 
London-based  group).  While  the 
rhetoric  is  a  kind  of  feminism  heavily 
dosed  with  Marxism,  the  struggle  is 
to  have  the  State  reward  housework. 
This  means  that  whoever  does  work 
which  is  classified  as  household- 
bound  is  engaged  in  economically 
productive    activity,    and    therefore, 


Can  Feminism  Be  a  Global  Ideology?/9 


like  any  other  producer,  deserves  a 
wage.  James'  demand  was  for  the 
State  to  pay  this  —  perhaps  some 
would  say  that  the  husband  should 
pay. 

How  would  this  demand  appear  in 
an  economy  with  massive  chronic 
unemployment  and  an  acute  shortage 
of  the  financial  resources  necessary 
to  utilize  the  unemployed  labour 
force?  Women  might  want  to  be 
employed  with  an  income,  and  to 
some,  employment  at  home  may  be 
ideal.  But  in  a  scarce  resource  situa- 
tion, would  housework  deserve 
priority  over  production  of  food  in 
schemes  that  generate  employment? 

Where  would  finances  be  raised 
for  this?  The  idealists  may  say  to 
reduce  defense  expenditure  or  steel 
mills  and  pay  the  women,  but  in 
some  socio-political  contexts  that  op- 
tion may  not  be  open.  Further,  would 
poor  rural  women  scraping  together 
twigs  and  berries  for  a  meal  in  a 
shack  feel  that  payment  for  this  work 
is  their  basic  demand? 

Another  dimension  to  this 
difference  lies  in  the  nature  of 
agrarian  economies  with  large  "pea- 
sant households,"  where  the  whole 
household  works.  Women  and  the 
old  engage  in  much  activity  that  is 
economically  productive,  even  in  the 
conventional  sense,  but  which  is  un- 
paid and  confined  to  the  household, 
such  as  grain  processing,  preparation 
of  household  articles,  textiles,  etc. 
Many  items  purchased  in  the  market 
in  advanced  economies  are  produced 
at  home  for  self-consumption.  When 
women  are  not  even  paid  for  this 
work,  what  is  the  context  for  paying 
them  for  cooking  and  cleaning?  What 
may  look  like  a  sensible  or  plausible 
demand     in     a     full    employment 


economy  with  some  access  to  wealth 
may  be  impossible  in  poorer  surplus- 
labour  economies. 

Female  vs.  Male 

Another  illustration  of  perceived 
attitudes  from  the  women's  liberation 
movement  that  often  do  not  find 
acceptance  here  is  the  anti-male  or 
female-versus-male  stand  taken  by 
some  groups.  One  off-shoot  of  this  is 
the  idea  that  if  it  is  proven  that 
women  are  superior  to  men, 
somehow  injustice  can  be  reversed. 
Another  corollary  is  the  often  un- 
conscious thrust  to  imitate  men  or 
take  their  lifestyles  as  the  goal  for 
women. 

These  female-versus-male  at- 
titudes are  often  rejected  because  of 
concepts  in  both  Eastern  religious 
and  agrarian  peasant  work  patterns 
that  are  based  on  the  assumption  of 
unity  and  complementary  functions 
of  male  and  female.  For  example, 
some  religions  reject  the  idea  that 
maleness  and  femaleness  are  in- 
dependent of  each  other,  such  as  the 
Ardhanareswara  (half-woman  — 
half-man).  This  idea  of  the 
"oneness"  of  male  and  female  finds 
operative  value  in  the  peasant 
agrarian  household  where  often 
superstition  bans  activities  according 
to  sex  but  where  without  the  two  u- 
niting,  an  object  cannot  be  made  or  a 
task  completed. 

For  example,  in  agriculture,  some 
believe  that  women  should  not  touch 
the  plough  and  men  should  not  sow 
the  seed,  but  if  the  two  combine  the 
crop  will  be  plentiful. 

In  an  agrarian  economy  where  sur- 
vival depends  on  the  economic  out- 
put of  the  household,  it  emerges  as  a 


10/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


Feminism  —  Global  Ideology?/ll 


unit  where  males  and  females  com- 
plement each  other.  They  see  each 
other's  importance  and  weave  a  life 
where  they  can  maximise  the  yield  to 
the  household  from  these  efforts. 
Hence  the  conflict  that  exists  between 
the  male  and  female  is  not  easily 
perceived  in  these  systems. 

Another  illustration  of  different 
perceptions  has  to  do  with 
motherhood,  which  in  most  of  these 
brown/black  areas  is  a  high  status 
sought  after  by  females.  While 
women  may  feel  oppressed  by  too 
many  births  or  by  domination  and 
exploitation  by  men,  they  still  take 
pride  in  being  mothers.  They  are  not 
eager  to  have  men  become  'mothers' 
—  to  do  nurturing  and  caring  —  and 
often  find  the  idea  comical.  Nor  do 
they  want  to  be  males. 

Separateness  vs.  Similarity 

In  a  sense  this  distaste  for  a 
philosophy  where  equality  is  un- 
derstood to  be  similarity  to  men,  is 
essentially  feminist,  as  I  understand 
it.  Woman-power  can  be  mobilized 
more  creatively  and  effectively  on  the 
basis  of  a  separate  identity  than  on  a 
similarity  between  the  sexes.  The 
Black  Power  Movement  illustrates 
the  success  of  this  approach.  As  long 
as  Negroes  wanted  assimilation  on 
the  basis  of  claiming  similarity  or 
appeals  to  liberal  attitudes,  they 
remained  disunited  as  well  as 
neglected.  But  once  they  decided  to 
assert  their  essential  differences,  and 
segregated  themselves  from  whites  — 
whether  poor  or  rich  —  their 
mobilization  was  vibrant  and 
dynamic. 

Self-confidence  is  the  beginning  of 
all  power.  The  recognition  of  self  as 


valuable  for  being  what  it  is  can  be  a 
strong  basis  for  solidarity  among  the 
oppressed  whether  black  in  a  white 
society,  female  in  a  male  dominated 
society  or  Muslim  in  a  Hindu  society. 

Separatism,  however,  is  not  a  new 
political  philosophy.  Its  advantages 
and  disadvantages  have  been  dis- 
cussed for  centuries,  and  obviously, 
as  in  most  philosophical  debates, 
there  is  no  self-evident  correct  choice. 
It  all  depends  on  who  you  are  and 
how  it  looks  to  you. 

In  India,  regarding  the  strategy  for 
ensuring  justice  for  the  untouchables 
(they  are  referred  to  as  Harijans  or 
Scheduled  Castes  in  today's  India), 
there  was  a  strong  controversy 
between  Mahatma  Gandhi  and  Dr. 
Ambedkar  (a  Harijan  leader)  around 
this  issue  of  separation.  Dr. 
Ambedkar  wanted  the  Harijans  to 
dissociate  themselves  from  the 
religion  which  practiced  un- 
touchability  (Hinduism)  and  con- 
verted millions  of  Harijans  to 
Buddhism.  (Christianity  also  at- 
tracted its  largest  proportion  of  con- 
verts from  this  class).  Dr.  Ambedkar 
also  wanted  to  press  for  a  separate 
political  party  of  Harijans  and 
reserved  accommodation  for  them  in 
all  the  roads  to  opportunity  and 
power. 

Gandhi  rejected  this  separation  by 
appealing  to  the  virtues  of  unity, 
compassion,  self-purification.  The 
Harijans  are  already  isolated,  he 
argued,  and  would  further  be  isolated 
if  they  separated.  Gandhi's  percep- 
tion of  the  human  being  was  of  the 
loving  being  who  can  be  healed  by 
being  shown  his  error.  It  was  not 
only  the  Harijans  who  were  suf- 
fering, he  said,  so  too  the  caste  Hin- 
dus who  ill-treated  them,  as  they  suf- 


12/Quest 


fered  morally/spiritually.  The  two 
would  become  "one"  when  this  was 
recognised. 

In  this  debate,  Gandhi  won.  Since 
the  condition  of  the  Harijans  has  not 
improved  much,  supporters  of  the 
Harijan  community  suggest  that  their 
continued  oppression  is  because  of 
this  rejection  of  separatism.  They 
believe  that  they  could  have  had 
greater  power  through  solidarity  than 
through  integration. 

Another  rejection  of  separatism 
comes  from  a  different  political 
quarter  —  Marxism.  In  this  case,  the 
class  is  asked  to  unite  against  the  op- 
pressors irrespective  of  colour  and 
religion  and  sex.  Any  attempt  at 
seeking  a  separate  identity  within  the 
classes  is  seen  as  betrayal  of  the  class 
struggle.  The  Marxists'  say:  First 
throw  out  the  system,  then  let  us  sort 
out  our  differences,  or  the  exploiter 
will  divide  and  rule. 

However,  all  evidence  points  out 
that  the  poor/the  workers  are  not  a 
homogeneous  lot.  And  women  are  the 
largest  sub-set  of  the  poor  whose  in- 
terests do  not  coincide  with  the  men 
of  their  own  class.  Indian 
demographic  data  of  the  last  forty 
years  raises  many  grave  doubts  about 
the  proposition  that  sex  should  not 
divide  the  working  class.  While 
economic  development  of  a  sort  has 
been  taking  place  —  not  enough  but 
more  food,  more  schools,  more  health 
facilities,  etc.  —  the  discrepancy 
between  the  conditions  for  males  and 
females  has  been  widening.  Among 
infants,  females  die  at  higher  rates 
than  males;  this  persists  right  up  to 
middle  age  and  the  gap  between  these 
rates  is  increasing.  The  same  gap 
between  male  and  females  is  true  in 
literacy.    In    India,    and    globally, 


women  are  displaced  from  incoming- 
earning  opportunities  with 
technological  progress  or  other  forms 
of  "modernization." 

When  Marxists  associate  exploita- 
tion with  the  advent  of  capitalism, 
there  often  is  sentimental  yearning 
for  pre-capitalist  society,  symbolised 
in  the  peasant  society.  Here  man, 
woman  and  child  worked  har- 
moniously in  one  household 
producing  for  self -consumption  with 
no  surplus,  no  exploitation.  Exten- 
ding this  picture,  it  is  often  argued 
that  women  had  positive  fundamen- 
tal roles  to  play  in  a  peasant  society 
and  therefore  status. 

But  was  pre-capitalist  society  real- 
ly all  that  perfect  for  women?  Parts  of 
traditional  India  a  century  ago  could 
still  be  considered  peasant  society 
and  many  households  today  still 
resemble  the  peasant  household.  In 
such  societies,  female  infanticide  was 
practiced,  along  with  Suttee  (crema- 
tion of  a  widow  on  the  funeral  pile  of 
her  husband),  dowry  (payment  by 
bride  to  bridegroom)  and  polygamy. 
Does  this  indicate  that  equal 
economic  roles  ensure  equality  with, 
or  respect  by,  males? 

In  my  view  it  indicates  that 
whatever  the  economic  system,  there 
was  and  still  is,  inequality  between 
the  sexes.  The  economic  system  does 
not  provide  the  solution,  as  it  only 
resolves  one  area  of  conflict. 
Economic  independence  and  strength 
may  be  a  necessary  but  is  not  a  suf- 
ficient condition  for  assuring 
women's  liberty. 

Unity  within  the  Sex 

Can  one  ask  Indian  women  to 
quietly  accept  devastation  until  the 


Feminism  —  Global  Ideology?/l3

system  is  changed?  Obviously  the 
benefits  of  development  are  accruing 
unequally  between  the  sexes.  There  is 
a  case  for  unity  within  the  sex  and  a 
need  for  pressure  for  equalizating  the 
inequity. 

The  experiences  of  women  seem  to 
suggest  that  whatever  the  standard  of 
living  and  the  economic  system, 
women  feel  exploited,  are  oppressed 
and  get  unequal  shares  of  and/or 
access  to  development.  There  may  be 
sharp  differences  among  women 
from  different  cultures  and 
economies  on  the  issues  of  who  is  the 
enemy  and  what  are  women's  real 
needs.  There  may  also  be  strong 
feelings  about  the  attitude  towards 
men  —  depending  on  the  base 
relationship  in  that  situation  between 
men  and  women.  Hence  the 
mainspring  of  action  may  not  be  anti- 
male,  but  that  should  not  be  con- 
sidered the  inverse  of  female  solidari- 
ty. Solidarity  need  not  be  against 
something  but  just  for  something. 

There  seems  to  be  a  case  for 
women  to  unite  for  their  preservation 
and  growth  within  the  class,  whether 
poor,  or  peasants  or  comrades.  In  this 
sense,  there  is  a  case  for  separatism  at 
least  in  the  first  round.  It  follows 
then  that  there  is  a  case  for  feminism 
—  and  that  this  would  be  relevant 
irrespective  of  stages  of  economic 
growth,  culture  or  religion.  If 
feminism  is  to  flourish  and  grow  as  a 
uniting  philosophy  for  women  as  a 
sex  —  and  certainly  it  has  the  seeds 
for  such  a  life  —  then  women  need  to 
identify  themselves  as  a  sex  for  their 
greater  strength  and  acceptance. 

However,  female  unity  can  only  be 
a  means  to  an  end  —  namely 
equality.  It  is  necessary  because  the 
base-line  situation  is  one  of  inequali- 


ty. It  is  here  then  that  we  see  that 
separatism  can  only  be  a  first  step.  It 
cannot  be  the  goal.  If  the  unity  of 
women  separated  them  from  men,  as 
a  final  result,  then  the  very  roots  of 
sexual  identity  are  removed. 

Women  have  to  engage  in  tar  more 
reflection  in  order  to  specify  their 
goals,  not  in  terms  of  equality  alone 
but  in  terms  of  social  organization.  A 
central  issue  would  be  the  family  — 
whether  its  conventional  form  is 
suited  to  women's  quest.  Perhaps 
women  will  divide  across  cultures  in 
their  views  but  that  should  not 
matter.  It  is  a  point  on  which 
feminists  should  think  globally  as 
well  as  separately  —  assessing  models 
as  they  exist  in  different  cultures  and 
choosing  what  seems  'ideal'.  They 
should  construct  together  and 
separately  the  world  in  which  they 
can  imagine  their  fulfillment. 

In  all  these  endeavours,  a  globally 
uniting  feminism  can  be  invaluable, 
for  it  brings  diverse  experiences 
together  and  provides  the  base  for 
reflection  and  choice.

Sisters, 

I  just  finished  reading 
"Race,  Class,  &  Cul- 
ture". It  was  laid  on  me 
last  month,  as  an  as- 
signment for  my  study 
group.  Reading  it  made 
me  feel  once  more,  con- 
nected to  other  Black 
Feminists. 

For  the  last  two  years, 
I've  been  searching  all 
the  feminist  papers  and 
journals  that  I  could  find 
for  information  on 
"Third  World"  fem- 
inists. Needless  to  say 
I  found  little. 

Last  year  I  tried  to  join 
the  National  Black 
Feminist  Organization, 
but  I  was  too  late.  I've 
tried  to  find  a  Black 
Feminist  newspaper,  but 
no  luck.  M  aybe  I 
searched  wrong  or  didn't 
look  far  enough  but  I 
found  nothing. 

Here  in  Albany  there's 
only  three  black 
feminists  who  are  "out", 
i.e.  attend  meetings  and 
women's  functions.  As 
far  as  I  can  see,  and  it's 
pretty  easy  to  tell,  I  am 
the    only    active    one. 


Sometimes,  I  feel  like  an 
extinct  item.  I  still  feel 
selfconscious  in  crowds 
of  feminists  and  am 
always  expecting  women 
to  expect  me  to  be  the 
expert  on  poor  women 
and  our  problems. 

When  I  was  handed 
Quest,  I  felt  both  excite- 
ment and  depression. 
Because  as  much  as  I 
wanted  to  read  it,  I  felt  I 
couldn't  as  I  had  tried 
before  and  couldn't 
understand  it  as  I  only 
have  a  tenth  grade 
education.  Reading  it 
was  difficult  and  I  reread 
a  lot  of  things  and  had  to 
look  up  a  lot  of  words, 
but  it  was  well  worth  it. 

I  was  taken  out  of  the 
black  community  at 
eleven  and  placed  in  an 
all  white  girls  school 
(360  students,  only  4 
blacks).  For  close  to  ten 
years  I  have  had  very  lit- 
tle to  do  with  the  com- 
munity, now  I  find 
myself,  full  circle,  work- 
ing in  the  community. 
The  racism  that's  in  me 
is  frightening.  For  so 
long  I  as  a  poor  black, 


lived  in  a  white,  middle 
class  world  and  so  much 
of  that  is  me.  It  shames 
me  to  think  of  the  times 
I've  turned  my  back  on 
my  culture  and  my  peo- 
ple. 

I'm    now    trying    to 
overcome    my   years   of 
brainwashing,  but  am  in 
desperate   need  of  sup- 
port. The  women  of  the 
feminist  community  try, 
but    can't    understand. 
Could  you   please  send 
me   the   address   of   the 
National    Alliance    of 
Black  Feminists?

The  Editors 


16/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


Dear  Quest  Editors: 

We  were  of  course 
gratified  that  three  of 
our  members  were  quo- 
ted in  Bev  Fisher's  art- 
icle, "Race  &  Class:  Be- 
yond Personal  Politics," 
(Quest,  vol.  Ill,  #4, 
Spring,  1977). 

However,  we  would 
like  to  point  out  that 
working  class  women  in 
general  and  the  Nation- 
al Congress  of  Neigh- 
borhood Women 
(NCNW)  in  particular 
have  a  very  different 
view  of  the  Displaced 
Homemakers  bill . 
NCNW  endorsed  it  as 
an  important  new  work- 
ing class  issue  and  is  ac- 
tively supporting  it. 
Marie  Casella,  one  of  the 
working  class  women 
quoted  in  your  article, 
testified  in  favor  of  the 
bill  at  a  special  confer- 
ence held  in  The  White 
House  in  June,  1977.  We 
were  active  in  pushing 
for  the  New  York  State 
bill  (it  passed)  and  are 
now  pressing  for  pass- 
age of  the  Federal  bill 
which  will  be  con- 
sidered by  the  Congress 
in  the  Fall  session. 

Despite  Bev  Fisher's 
flat  statement  that  the 
Displaced  Home- 
maker's  bill  advocates 
"job  training  for  one 
group  of  women  so  they 


will  be  able  to  hire 
household  workers,"  we 
hope  the  editorial  staff 
will  take  a  little  harder 
look  at  this  legislation 
with  working  class 
women  in  mind. 

The  bill  will  affect 
millions  of  working  class 
women  —  black,  brown 
and  white.  Most  work- 
ing class  women  do  not 
take  on  an  extra  job  out- 
side the  home  unless 
they  are  in  need  of 
money.  What  jobs  they 
can  get  are  usually  low 
level  and  low  paid  and 
therefore  inadequate  for 
their  needs  when  the 
other  wage  earner  in  the 
family  dies  or  leaves. 
This  is  true  even  when 
they  are  young  women. 
When  they  are  between 
forty  and  sixty  (the  wo- 
men covered  by  the  Dis- 
placed Homemakers 
bill),  they  are  often  in 
dire  circumstances  with 
no  place  to  turn  but  wel- 
fare. They  are  too  young 
for  social  security,  too 
unskilled  for  decent  pay- 
ing jobs,  and  too  "old" 
to  be  considered  "desir- 
able" employees  in  a 
sexist  marketplace.  In 
addition,  many  who 
worked  only  in  the 
home,  may  never  be  en- 
titled to  social  security  at 
all. 

For    all    the    above 


reasons,    we    think    the 
Displaced    Homemakers 
Act  serves  a  real  need  for 
working    class    women. 
We  hope  Quest  will  re- 
examine it  and  join  us  in 
support. 
Sincerely,

On  the 
Political  Economy  of 
Domestic  Labour 


By  ANJA  MEULENBELT,  Johanna's  Daughter

Introduction 

Dutch  feminists  are  in  a  rather 
privileged  position:  we  get  all  the  in- 
teresting material  from  the  surround- 
ing countries.  We  read  about  the 
French,  English,  German,  and 
American  movements.  But  the 
exchange  is  one-sided.  Only  the 
Dutch  read  Dutch.  To  change  that, 
we've  translated  some  of  the  material 
that's  in  use  in  the  socialist  feminist 
movement  in  the  Netherlands.  This 
article  was  written  two  years  ago  and 
is  already  dated.  It  has  been  widely 
used  by  both  feminist  and  socialist 
groups.  Justified  criticism  and  new 
material  have  been  collected  since 
then,  and  although  I  have  considered 
re-writing  it,  I  decided  that  the  article 
would  have  to  be  altered  so  much 
that  I  might  as  well  write  a  complete- 
ly new  one.  Instead,  I've  decided  to 
list  the  shortcomings  of  the  article  as 
it  stands. 

1.  The  article  puts  too  much 
emphasis  on  the  economic  value  of 
domestic  labour  and  not  enough  on 
the  ideological  side  of  the  matter.  At 
the  time  this  article  was  written  we 
were  so  excited  by  the  discovery  that 
sexism  was  not  simply  an  ideological 


issue  but  an  economic  one  as  well 
that  we  turned  too  much  to  that  side. 
Reading  the  article,  one  might  think 
that  the  family  is  just  a  place  for  the 
production  of  labour  power.  If  it 
were  written  now,  much  more  would 
be  added  about  the  family  and 
political  consciousness,  about  the 
way  sexism  as  an  ideology  permeates 
the  family.  When  we  put  the  material 
on  wage  labour  beside  material  on 
power  relations  in  the  family,  we  find 
a  strong  correlation  between  a  low 
position  in  the  workplace,  and  a 
tendency  to  find  an  alternative  status 
as  a  'man'  outside  it.  In  a  way,  op- 
pressing women  keeps  oppressed 
men  satisfied.  And  in  that  way,  in- 
directly, capitalism  profits  from 
women's  oppression,  not  only  from 
their  material  work. 

2.  Following  the  first  point,  we 
now  know  more  about  what  domestic 
labour  meant  in  different  historical 
periods  and  in  different  social  layers 
of  the  population.  The  labour- 
process  has  changed  (documented  by 
Harry  Braverman,  in  Labor  and 
Monopoly  Capital)  and  so  has 
domestic  labour.  More  should  be 
written  about  the  way  in  which  the 


IS/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


degradation  of  labour  puts  a  heavier 
burden  on  the  housewife. 

3.  An  important  shortcoming  in 
the  article  is  that  little  is  said  about 
the  function  of  the  State.  It  seems  as 
if  the  only  relation  between 
capitalism  and  the  family  is  through 
the  labour  power  of  wage  labourers. 
We  need  to  work  out  reasons  why  the 
State  came  to  take  control  over  large 
parts  of  the  reproduction  of  labour- 
power  that  were  previously  a 
domestic    task   (such    as    education, 

health,  and  social  work). 

4.  More  should  be  said  about  the 
effects  of  the  current  economic  and 
political  crisis  on  the  lives  of  women, 
both  at  home  and  in  wage  labour,  es- 
pecially since  this  is  already  well- 
documented  in  England. 

5.  Finally,  more  could  be  said 
about  the  relation  between  capitalist 
social  relations  and  patriarchy,  about 
the  way  in  which  sexism  is  not  only  a 
tool  of  capitalism,  but  also  much 
more  than  that;  and  so,  about  the 
relation  between  feminism  and 
socialism.  Still,  we  hope  to  give  you 
an  impression  of  what  is  being  done 
in  the  Netherlands.* 
Amsterdam,  Feb.  23,  1977 

"You  are  no  historical  category/'  a 
(male)  Marxist  once  furiously 
snapped  at  me.  He  meant  that  he  did 
not  like  women  to  organize 
themselves  as  a  group  outside  the 
labour  movement,  for  he  did  not  un- 
derstand what  common  ties  women 
had  that  could  be  as  important  as  the 
tie  that  binds  people  who  are  depen- 
dent on  wages. 

In  this  article  we  shall  begin  a  re- 
definition of  women's  position  based 

*Quest  is  printing  a  shortened  version  of  the 
original  paper. 


on  the  whole  of  women's 
experiences.  We  cannot  confine 
ourselves  to  what  has  already  of- 
ficially been  labeled  'relevant  to  the 
class  struggle.'  To  discover  the 
material  basis  of  sexism  we  should 
look  beyond  women's  dependence  on 
wages  to  the  amount  of  work  women 
perform  in  their  families,  and  to  the 
ways  that  influence  their  con- 
sciousness. 

Economic  oppression  goes  hand  in 
hand  with  ideological  oppression. 
The  power  relations  in  the  family  are 
determined  both  by  women's  subor- 
dination to  men  and  by  the  subor- 
dination of  men  and  women  to 
capital.  In  the  following  article  we 
briefly  describe  the  classic  Marxist 
analyses  of  the  position  of 
housewives  with  reference  to  the 
main  articles  on  the  subject.1  We  then 
discuss  the  dialectical  relationship 
between  women's  position  in  wage 
work  and  their  function  in  the  home. 
Finally,  we  bring  together  the  various 
interests  of  capital  in  maintaining  the 
position  of  women  in  the  nuclear 
family,  and  we  consider  the  con- 
tradictions between  these  interests. 

Traditional  Marxist  Analysis 

Engels  was  particularly  important 
in  developing  the  theory  that 
women's  oppression  is  inherent  in 
the  capitalist  system  even  if  women's 
domination  by  men,  the  patriarchy, 
had  existed  long  before.  His  view  of 
the  position  of  women  was  developed 
in  a  period  in  which  the  work  of  the 
family  was  gradually  being  taken 
over  by  industry.  Men,  and  often 
wives  and  children,  were  forced  to 
enter  wage  work  to  keep  the  family 
alive.    Engels    expected    that,    as 


On  the  Political  Economy  of  Domestic  Labour/19 


production  gradually  disappeared 
from  the  family  and  women  were  in- 
creasingly pressed  to  enter  wage 
work,  the  remaining  domestic  labour 
would  be  taken  over  by  public  ser- 
vices.  A   socialist  revolution  would 


on  women's  position.  Women's 
emancipation  is  measured  by 
women's  participation  in  the  produc- 
tion process,  not  by  men's  participa- 
tion in  the  reproduction  process, 
pending    its    socialization.    But 


follow  and  the  socialization  of 
production  and  domestic  labour 
would  culminate  in  a  network  of 
collective  state  services:  creches,* 
dining  rooms,  laundries.  Engels' 
views  led  to  the  slogan,  "Women  in 
wage  work  to  develop  a  revolution- 
ary potential." 

Since  Engels,  essentially  no  new 
Marxist  theory  has  been  developed 

*Creche  is  the  British  word  for  day  care  center. 


women's  domestic  labour  has  not 
been  taken  over  by  the  public  sector, 
as  Engels  expected.  And  we  have  not 
much  reason  to  suppose  that  this  will 
happen  as  long  as  capital  has  so  little 
interest  in  the  socialization  of 
domestic  labour.  Moreover,  in  those 
cases  in  which  men  and  women  both 
have  full-time  jobs,  women  appear  to 
take  on  a  second  shift.  The  problem 
is  now:  Is  the  family  really  only  a 
superstructural   phenomenon?   Why 


20/Quest 


does  it  still  exist?  What  is  the  func- 
tion of  domestic  labour?  And  what 
does  it  mean  for  the  strategy  of 
women's  liberation  and  ultimately 
the  strategy  for  changing  the 
capitalist  society? 

Feminist  Interest  In  Housewives 

The  failure  of  the  leftist  movement 
to  make  an  anlaysis  that  was 
specifically  relevant  to  women  has 
been  one  of  the  causes  of  the  rise  of 
the  second  feminist  wave.  Almost 
anyone  in  the  leftist  movement  felt  a 
curious  resistance  against  analysing 
her/his  own  attitude  towards 
women:  concrete  conditions  of  living 
were  not  to  be  discussed. 

The  division  in  leftist  discussions 
between  'political'  and  'personal'  cor- 
related with  the  contrast  between  the 
functions  of  men  (wage  labour)  and 
women  (domestic  labour).  Only  the 
work  that  was  directly  related  to 
production  was  considered  politically 
relevant.  Women's  work— caring,  sup- 
porting, absorbing  tensions,  etc.  — 
was  not  considered  labour.  The  leftist 
movement  therefore  found  it  im- 
possible to  interpret  the  conflicts 
between  men  and  women  as  other 
than  private  matters.  It  was  only  in 
the  feminist  movement  that  we  dis- 
covered that  the  division  between 
personal  and  political  matters,  also 
manifest  in  leftist  groups,  correlates 
with  the  division  between  production 
(political)  and  reproduction  (per- 
sonal). 

The  Lines  Meet:  The  First 
Feminist-Marxist  Analysis 

Margaret  Benston,  in  the  early 
seventies,  wrote  an  important  article 
attempting  to  examine  the  material 


basis  of  women's  oppression.2  She 
was  the  first  to  see  that  the  family  is 
still  a  production  unit.  Women's  op- 
pression, she  argues,  is  therefore  not 
so  much  due  to  the  marginality  of 
their  work,  as  to  the  way  her  work 
has  been  subordinated  to  both  capital 
and  wage  labour.  Benston  compares 
domestic  labour  with  peasants'  or 
serfs'  argricultural  labour,  a  type  of 
production  that  had  already  been  in 
existence  before  the  rise  of 
capitalism.  The  housewife  bears 
responsibility  for  the  simple  produc- 
tion of  use  values  for  consumption 
by  members  of  the  family,  a  task 
which  has  by  no  means  been  taken 
over  by  industry.  Hodee  Edwards 
carries  the  argument  a  step  further  in 
her  article  "Housework  and 
Exploitation."3  When  a  man  is  hired 
to  do  a  job,  she  states,  the  labour 
power  he  sells  is  a  commodity  that  is 
his,  but  one  which  the  housewife 
produced  without  receiving  any 
wage.  In  all  other  cases  this  would  be 
called  slavery.  It  is  an  anachronism. 
Consequently  there  is  not  only  a  con- 
tradiction between  capital  and  wage 
labour,  but  also  between  wage  labour 
and  the  pre-capitalist  slave  labour  of 
housewives. 

Within  the  capitalist  system  we 
can  see  remnants  of  patriarchal 
ownership  relations  in  which  women 
are  men's  property.  The  idea  that  a 
woman  is  a  man's  property  appears 
to  exist  implicitly  even  in  un- 
suspected circles.  Marx  wrote,  "But 
now  the  capitalist  buys  children  and 
young  persons  under  age.  Previously 
the  workman  sold  his  labour-power, 
which  he  disposed  of  nominally  as  a 
free  agent.  Now  he  sells  wife  and 
child.  He  has  become  a  slave- 
dealer."4 


Domestic  Labour/21 


One  can  criticize  these  rough 
analyses  of  the  women  who  first 
looked  for  a  material  basis  for 
women's  oppression.  It  is  true, 
domestic  labour  seems  to  bear  a 
likeness  to  agricultural  labour:  it  is 
production  for  one's  own  sub- 
sistence. But  agricultural  production 
will  gradually  lose  importance  as 
farmers  become  dependent  on  wages 
in  agricultural  industries.  Those  who 
describe  domestic  labour  as  a  pre- 
capitalist phenomenon  imply  that  it 
will  change  just  as  the  farmer's  posi- 
tion is  changing.  Housewives, 
however,  are  not  a  dying  species  as 
yet;  a  number  of  tasks  performed  by 
today's  housewives  are  so  labour- 
intensive,  and  would  therefore  be  so 
expensive  if  they  were  performed  in 
wage  labour,  that  there  is  not  much 
hope  that  this  situation  will  soon 
change  by  itself.5 

Maria  Rosa  dalla  Costa  and  Selma 
James  developed  a  second  theory  in 
the  initial  stages  of  the  search  for 
the  connection  between  domestic 
labour  and  the  capitalist  system.6 
They  take  the  line  that  house- 
wives produce  the  main  commodity 
necessary  for  carrying  on  pro- 
duction: they  produce  the  worker 
himself.  Housewives  are  unpaid 
workers  in  the  proletariat,  exploited 
by  their  husbands  as  well  as  by 
capital.  The  strategy  for  the  feminist 
movement  should  be,  therefore: 
STRIKE.  No  domestic  labour  should 
be  done  until  women,  like  men,  are 
paid  for  their  work.  The  subsequent 
analyses  of  Secombe,  Gardiner, 
Himmelweit,  Vogel,  to  name  a  few, 
have  effectively  refuted  James  and 
dalla  Costa,  who  have  confused  two 
things:  the  general  definition  of 
productive'    as    'useful'    with    the 


strictly  Marxist  definition  of 
'productive'  as  'creating  surplus, 
value.'  Domestic  labour  does  not  fall 
within  the  latter  definition  because 
the  housewife  does  not  sell  her  labour 
power  for  wages.7 

This  point  is  not  only  important 
for  Marxist  purists.  The  very  fact 
that  capital  cannot  draw  surplus 
value  from  domestic  labour  deter- 
mines the  way  in  which  the  latter  is 
organised.  It  is  labour  necessary  for 
the  continuation  of  the  production 
process,  but  as  long  as  the  housewife 
can  go  on  reproducing  workers  day 
after  day  and  generation  after  genera- 
tion, the  capitalist  does  not  care  how 
many  hours  she  spends  each  day,  nor 
whether  she  works  efficiently,  or 
has  the  right  appliances.  This  is  one 
of  the  main  reasons  why  socialization 
of  domestic  labour  has  lagged  so 
much  behind  socialization  of  produc- 
tive labour.  The  later  analyses  lead  us 
to  suspect  that  domestic  labour  is  a 
separate  economic  category  that  can 
neither  be  described  in  terms  of 
'productive'  or  'unproductive,'  nor 
explained  as  a  pre-capitalist  pheno- 
menon. 

The  Housewife's  Life 

Eighty-five  to  ninety  percent  of 
women  are  housewives,  which  means 
that  they  are  responsible  for  the  care 
of  husband  and/or  children  and/or 
other  members  of  the  family  without 
receiving  any  wages.8  It  is  generally 
thought  that  housewives  have  little  to 
do  —  they  are  mainly  seen  as  con- 
sumers; they  'do  not  work';  they  are 
'kept'  by  their  husbands.  This 
'absence  of  work'  certainly  takes  a 
surprisingly  long  working  week. 
Nearly  all  studies  find  that  the 
housewive's    working    week    lies 


22/Quest 


between  50  and  100  hours  a  week.9 
The  average  working  week  of  British 
housewives  with  one  little  child  or 
more  is  77  hours  a  week.  This  is  7 
hours  more  than  15  years  ago.10 

Domestic  labour  brings  about 
some  very  characteristic  symptoms. 
Many  women  are  chronically  tired.  A 
much-heard  complaint  of 
housewives  is  that  they  are  dead-tired 
at  the  end  of  the  day  from  being  con- 
stantly busy,  but  that  they  do  not 
know  what  they  have  done. 
Domestic  labour  hardly  ever  yields  a 
visible  product.  Clean  floors  will  be 
full  of  muddy  footprints  within  an 
hour;  meals  take  half  an  hour  to  dis- 
appear. Indeed,  much  of  the 
housewife's  work  only  becomes 
visible  when  it  is  not  done.  There  is  a 
specific  form  of  alienation  inherent  in 
the  housewife's  existence:  invisible 
work  that  must  be  done  and  for 
which  nothing  is  received  in  return.11 

The  difference  between  the  work 
of  a  housewife  and  that  of  a  wage 
worker  becomes  clear  when  we  put 
them  side  by  side.  The  wage  worker 
sells  his  labour  power  as  a  commodi- 
ty for  a  certain  period  in  exchange  for 
a  wage  paid  in  money;  the  rest  of  the 
time  is  his;  there  is  a  sharp  distinction 
between  work  and  leisure.12  From  an 
emotional  and  a  physical  viewpoint 
he  sees  production  and  consumption 
as  two  completely  different  activities. 
For  the  housewife  the  house  is  her 
workplace;  even  in  her  leisure  hours 
she  does  not  get  away  from  it.  For  her 
there  is  no  sharp  distinction  between 
work  and  leisure,  neither  in  place  nor 
in  time.  She  gets  no  wage  for  her 
work  and  no  one  other  than  herself  is 
interested  in  the  amount  of  time  she 
spends  in  doing  her  work,  as  long  as 
it  is  done.   She   is   under  no  direct 


capitalist    pressure    to    increase    her 
productivity  per  hour. 

Relation  Between 
Housewives  and  Capital 

Housewives  seem  to  work  only  for 
the  members  of  their  families,  with 
whom  they  have  emotional  rather 
than  monetary  ties.  There  is  an  ap- 
parent exchange  of  tasks  in  the  fami- 
ly that  has  nothing  to  do  with 
production  relations:  the  husband 
hands  over  his  wage,  the  wife  gives 
physical  and  mental  care  in  return. 
The  fact  that  capital  has  an  obvious 
interest  in  maintaining  that  structure 
is  overlooked.  The  interest  of  capital 
in  maintaining  that  structure  is 
overlooked.  The  interest  of  capital  in 
maintaining  the  family  becomes 
visible  when  we  think  of  what  would 
happen  if  every  worker  had  to  look 
after  himself  in  addition  to  doing  his 
job.  He  would  have  substantially  less 
energy  for  his  tasks  in  the  production 
process  and  less  work  could  be 
squeezed  out  of  him  per  hour.  If,  in- 
stead of  caring  for  himself,  he  looked 
for  substitute  services  in  the  public 
sector  (restaurants,  laundries,  char- 
women, and  so  on),  he  would  certain- 
ly need  a  higher  wage.13  Today's 
wages  are  actually  based  on  the 
presumption  that  they  are  not  only 
set  off  by  the  man's  labour  power, 
but  also  by  the  housewife's. 
Domestic  labour  really  consists  in  the, 
reproduction  of  the  commodity, 
labour  power. 

Relation  Between  Consumption  And 
Reproduction:  Subsistence  Level 

Up  to  now,  Marxist  theory  has  left 
a  mysterious  gap  between  the  mo- 


Domestic  Labour/23 


tftftjtimt 


'Mvf- 


24/Quest 


ment  the  worker  takes  home  his  wage 
and  the  moment  he  resells  his  labour 
power.  This  intervening  period  has 
been  called  'consumption/  thus  con- 
cealing the  fact  that  a  packet  of  soup, 
bought  with  wages,  only  becomes 
consumable  by  adding  the 
housewife's  labour.  Marx  never 
denied  that  consumption  and 
reproduction  of  labour  power  were 
two  aspects  of  the  same 
phenomenon. 

Labour  power  is  a  commodity,  and 
its  production  is  essential  for  capital 
because  it  is  the  only  commodity  that 
creates  value  and  therefore  the  only 
one  from  which  surplus  value  can  be 
drawn.  Like  any  other  commodity 
labour  power  has  two  aspects:  the 
aspect  of  its  exchange  value  and  that 
of  its  use  value.  The  use  value  of 
labour  power  is  the  amount  of  work 
carried  out  by  the  worker;  the 
exchange  value  of  labour  power  is  the 
socially  necessary  labour  essential  for 
its  production.  Aside  from  the  con- 
tribution of  public  education  and 
health  care,  the  production  of  labour 
power  in  the  family  does  not  directly 
yield  surplus  value  to  capital.  The 
conclusion  can  be  drawn  that 
domestic  labour  is  a  special  economic 
category  for  which  we  as  yet  have  no 
adequate  term. 

It  is  the  special  character  of 
domestic  labour  that  it  does  not  so 
much  consist  of  a  high  production 
per  hour  as  of  a  permanent  availabili- 
ty in  which  production  per  hour  is 
not  important.  If  we  look  at  domestic 
labour  from  yet  another  viewpoint,14 
we  reach  the  conclusion  that  the 
specific  contribution  of  domestic 
labour  to  capital  cannot  be  defined  in 
terms  of  surplus  value  or  even  sur- 
plus labour  but  as  a  means  to  keep 


wages  low.  "The  contribution  which 
domestic  labour  makes  to  surplus 
value  is  one  of  keeping  down 
necessary  labour  to  a  level  that  is 
lower  than  the  actual  subsistence 
level  of  the  working  class."15 

The  Housewife's  New  Task 

Which  factors  have  influenced  the 
lengthening  of  the  housewife's 
working  week  are  still  matters  for 
debate.  Housewives  appear  to  work 
even  harder  than  they  did  previously 
—  notwithstanding  all  the  time- 
saving  appliances.  A  possible  factor 
is  the  economic  crisis.  When  prices 
rise  faster  than  wages,  housewives 
must  work  harder.  Higher 
qualifications  for  wage  labour  power 
is  mentioned  as  another  factor  by 
Renate  Bookhagen.16  This  theory  is 
still  open  for  discussion.  It  is  doubt- 
ful whether  each  individual  worker 
has  better  qualifications  than  before, 
or  whether  there  has  been  an  increase 
in  the  qualifications  of  the  working 
class  as  a  whole  due  to  further 
specialization.17  It  is  probably  better 
to  talk  about  the  intensifying  of 
labour  as  the  important  factor  in  the 
aggravation  of  the  housewife's  task. 

How  the  increase  in  the  pace  of 
work  plus  the  economic  crisis  can 
aggravate  the  housewife's  task 
becomes  clear  when  there  is  a  call  for 
economy.  This  always  begins  in  the 
so-called  'soft-sector':  welfare  work, 
health  service,  etc.  Hospitals  are 
forced  to  lower  expenditures.  This 
implies  that  they  will  less  readily  take 
in  patients  and  that  they  will  send 
patients  home  sooner.  This  in  turn 
means  that  the  average  housewife 
will  have  to  work  harder.  But  no  one 
will  notice  as  long  as  this  concerns 


Domestic  Labour/25 


only  individual  women  each  caring 
for  her  own  individual  patient.18 

We  can  also  trace  the  increased 
burden  of  the  housewife  in  the 
women's  magazines.  After  the  first 
wave  of  articles  on  education,  there  is 
now  a  real  increase  in  instruction  for 
improving  the  marital  relationship.  A 
good  housewife  does  not  only  cook 
wholesome  meals,  she  also  prepares 
varied  and  sometimes  exotic  dishes; 
the  house  should  not  only  be  clean, 
but  also  well-decorated  (more  leisure 
hours  are  spent  around  the  TV  and 
less  in  the  pub). 

All  these  different  tendencies  are 
difficult  to  weigh  but  it  is  clear  that 
the  increase  of  the  housewife's 
burden  is  not  only  the  result  of  sub- 
jective factors,  of  the  ideology  of  the 
good  housewife,  the  women's 
magazines  trying  to  seduce  women  to 
an  ever-increasing  consumption  by 
eternally  dictating  new  fashions  in 
clothes,  furniture,  dishes.  There  are, 
at  the  same  time,  material  factors  at 
work. 

Power  Relations  Within  The  Family 

The  wage  form  only  obscures 
matters  for  the  worker  who  appears 
to  be  rewarded  for  his  labour,  not  for 
his  hiring  out  of  labour  power.  Ac- 
tually,  both  housewife  and 
breadwinner  supply  their  labour 
power  against  payment  for  their 
reproduction  cost.  But  the  incoming 
money  seems  to  be  the  result  of  the 
man's  labour,  not  his  wife's,  because 
the  man  sells  his  labour  power  in  the 
market  and  the  woman  works  at 
home  outside  direct  production. 
Because  the  husband  receives  the 
wage  as  his  own  well-earned  money, 
he  also  has  the  possibility  to  spend  it 


as  he  thinks  fit.  This  creates  a  mock 
relation  in  the  family  resembling  the 
one  between  employer  and  employee. 
According  to  Engels,  the  husband  is 
the  bourgeois  party  in  the  family,  and 
the  wife,  the  proletariat.19  The 
husband's  welfare  is  far  more  impor- 
tant than  the  wife's  because  she  has 
been  made  dependent  on  the  wage 
the  man  brings  home. 

In  the  above  paragraphs  we  put 
the  wage  worker  and  the  housewife 
side  by  side,  and  assumed  that 
housewives  work  primarily  at  home. 
In  the  Netherlands,  however,  one- 
third  of  the  women  are  engaged  in 
wage  work  and  the  number  of 
married  women  entering  work  is  still 
growing.  The  very  interaction 
between  both  spheres  is  important. 
The  fact  that  women  in  paid  employ- 
ment are  housewives  at  the  same  time 
is  reflected  in  their  consciousness.  In 
Marxist  analysis  we  have  learned  to 
define  political  consciousness  as  the 
awareness  of  being  dependent  on 
wages,  but  housewives  do  not  see 
themselves  as  dependent  on  wages. 
All  too  often  the  argument  has  been 
reversed,  and  it  has  been  said  that 
women  cannot  develop  political  con- 
sciousness from  their  own  situation 
unless  they  are  wage  workers. 

If  we  define  political  consciousness 
as  the  power  to  read  one's  own 
material  position  and  to  understand 
its  connection  with  capitalist  produc- 
tion relations,  it  will  be  clear  that 
housewives  too  can  reach  this  insight 
from  their  own  experiences  and 
situations.  Wage  workers  meet  each 
other  in  places  where  they  are 
exploited;  they  see  that  the  boss 
profits  by  them.  Women  are  isolated 
from  each  other.  The  ideology  of  the 
good  housewife  plays  an  important 


26/QUest 


NON-TRANSFERABLE 
EXCEPT  UNDER  CONDITIONS  PRESCRIB 


part  in  leading  discontented  women 
to  blame  themselves  or  some  ill- 
chosen  husband.  A  man  who  loathes 
his  work  and  revolts  is  called  class- 
conscious.  A  woman  who  loathes  her 
work  and  revolts  is  called  frustrated, 
neurotic  and  unfeminine. 

In  addition,  women  have  very 
limited  concrete  possibilities  for 
giving  shape  to  their  revolt.  Collec- 
tive resistence  hardly  exists,  in- 
dividual betterment  is  only  reserved 
for  a  small  group  of  women.  To 
strike  is  almost  impossible:  you  can 
hardly  starve  your  children  to  wrest 
better  labour  conditions  from  capital. 
Because  domestic  labour  is  related  to 
capital  in  indirect  and  complicated 
ways,  housewives  find  it  difficult  to 
discern  against  whom  or  what  they 


should  revolt.  The  old  patriarchal 
and  new  capitalist  forms  of  oppres- 
sion meet  in  the  family. 

If  it  is  true  that  housewives  are  a 
drag  on  the  class  struggle  (as  was  the 
case,  for  instance,  in  a  British  strike 
where  women  tried  to  break  the  strike 
more  with  the  family  interest  —  bread 
on  the  shelf  than  with  the  class  in- 
terest),10 the  reversal  is  also  true.  Men 
are  a  drag  on  women's  struggle  for  an 
independent  existence.  Even  leftist 
men,  even  proletarian  men,  have  dif- 
ficulties in  accepting  that  women  do 
not  belong  in  the  kitchen  by  nature, 
especially  if  it  implies  that  they  must 
largely  fend  for  themselves.  During 
an  Islington  strike  not  so  long  ago  in 
which  women  had  occupied  a  fac- 
tory, the  strongest  resistance  did  not 


Domestic  Labour/27 


come  from  the  manufacturer  but 
from  the  men  who  were  against  the 
occupation  because  it  forced  them  to 
cook  their  own  dinner  and  sleep 
alone. 

Influence  Of  The  Domestic  Function 
On  Women's  Position  In  Wage  Work 

Women's  positions  as  housewives 
clearly  influence  their  position  in 
wage  work  and  vice  versa.  Women 
earn  on  an  average  one-third  less 
than  men:  they  end  up  in  typically 
female  jobs  that  excel  in  monotony, 
lack  of  possibilities  for  promotion, 
with  poor  social  provisions.  The  in- 
fluence of  domestic  tasks  on 
women's  employment  is  clearly  seen 
in  Spittalsfield,  the  London  working 
class  neighbourhood  that  is  the 
traditional  housing  district  of 
workers  in  the  textile  industry.  All 
the  large  well-paying  firms  moved 
their  factories  elsewhere.  Only  the 
small  workshops  have  remained,  the 
sweatshops  that  can  only  exist 
because  of  abominable  payments  and 
primitive  working  conditions.  It  is 
the  women  who  land  in  these 
workshops  because  they  have  to  look 
for  work  close  enough  to  their  homes 
to  enable  them  to  do  their 
housework.  Underpaid  women's 
labour  appears  to  be  one  of  the 
mainstays  of  capitalism.  As  long  as 
women  primarily  see  themselves  as 
housewives  supported  by  husbands 
who  regard  women's  wage  work  as  a 
supplement  to  a  man's  wage,  change 
will  be  long  in  coming. 

Another  reason  for  women's  low 
pay  in  wage  labour  is  that  'skilled' 
labour  is  better  paid  than  'unskilled' 
labour  and  the  very  skills  needed  for 
'unskilled'    women's    labour    have 


already  been  learned  at  home  in  con- 
trast with  most  of  the  men's  skills. 
Their  socialization  as  housewives 
weakens  their  negotiating  position  in 
the  labour  market.  Because  all 
women  can  clean,  charwomen  can 
endlessly  be  replaced. 

Moreover,  women  cost  less  in 
social  provisions.  When  a  married 
woman  in  the  Netherlands  is  dis- 
missed, she  only  has  a  right  to  half  a 
year  of  unemployment  benefits;  after 
that  her  husband  is  supposed  to  sup- 
port her  again.  Many  labour 
exchanges  do  not  enter  married 
women  as  employment  seekers,  if 
they  have  not  already  worked 
somewhere  else.  Much  unemploy- 
ment is  kept  hidden;  the  official 
number  of  unemployed  simply  does 
not  register  a  large  number  of  un- 
employed married  women.  In  this 
way  women  function  as  an  elastic 
cheap  labour  reserve  that  can  be 
drawn  upon  whenever  industry 
needs  more  unskilled  labour  power 
and  sent  home  whenever  they  are  no 
longer  needed,  and  this  with  a 
minimum  of  extra  costs. 

In  the  strike  of  the  Philips  Hel- 
mond  women  in  opposition  to  the 
removal  of  the  factory,  it  became  evi- 
dent how  little  trade  unions  are  alive 
to  the  woman's  double  burden. 
Transfer  of  the  factory  would  have 
prevented  them  from  being  home  in 
time  to  cook  dinner.  The  largest  trade 
union  (NW)  did  not  declare  itself  in 
solidarity  with  the  strike;  the 
Catholic  trade  union  (NKV)  did  at 
first,  but  later  on  translated  the 
demands  of  the  occupying  women  in 
terms  of  general  employment  in  Hel- 
mond.  Neither  the  NKV  nor  the 
NVV  recognized  that  women's 
labour  conditions  are  not  only  deter- 


28/Quest 


mined  by  their  working  conditions 
but  also  by  their  responsibility 
toward  their  families.  On  the  one 
hand  trade  unions  do  not  want  to 
make  different  rules  for  women.  On 
the  other  hand  they  do  not  demand 
creches  and  factory  meals  which 
would  forestall  women's  need  for 
exceptional  treatment. 

Who  Has  An  Interest  In  The 
Survival  Of  The  Family? 

If  we  summarize  the  interests  of 
capital  in  maintaining  the  family  we 
find  the  following:  (1)  It  is  a  cheap 
way  of  guaranteeing  reproduction  of 
labour  power.  It  passes  the  respon- 
sibility for  people's  physical  and 
mental  health  on  to  the  family  and  es- 
pecially to  the  housewife;  (2) 
Domestic  labour  acts  as  a  buffer  in 
economic  crisis.  It  absorbs  the  first 
blows  and  thus  suppresses  the  wage 
struggle;  (3)  Consumption  can  be  in- 
creased by  keeping  families  isolated 
from  each  other;  (4)  The  family  is  the 
place  where  children  learn  in  play  to 
identify  sooner  with  family  interests 
than  with  class  interests. 

These  factors  hinder  the  socializa- 
tion of  domestic  labour.  As  long  as 
capital  has  so  much  interest  in  main- 
taining the  family,  capital  expen- 
diture in  collective  housework- 
replacing  provisions  is  not  to  be 
expected.  At  the  same  time,  there 
does  exist  a  factor  furthering  its  par- 
tial socialization  of  housework:  (5) 
Women  are  cheap  workers  when 
they  enter  wage  work,  because  they 
are  primarily  housewives.  It  follows 
from  this  that  there  is  a  contradiction 
in  the  various  kinds  of  interest  capital 
has  in  maintaining  the  family. 

There    is    a    limit    to    women's 


exploitation  and  it  has  become  clear 
that  women  working  in  both  paid 
employment  and  their  families  are 
worn  out  sooner  than  men.  As  is  the 
case  with  labourers  employed  in  ar- 
duous jobs,  most  women  with  a  dou- 
ble burden  completely  fail  to  reach 
the  retirement  age  in  their  jobs. 

Reproduction  of  new  workers  is 
especially  important  for  the  capitalist 
system  as  a  whole,  but  the  individual 
capitalist's  main  interest  lies  in  the 
direct  exploitation  of  women  in  wage 
work.  It  is  therefore  not  accidental 
that  in  times  of  expansion,  when 
there  is  a  greater  demand  for  female 
workers,  more  action  is  taken  to 
adapt  working  hours  and  make 
collective  provisions  for  domestic 
work. 

A  clear  illustration  of  this  point  is 
the  creche  situation  in  Great  Britain. 
Although  the  government  decreed  an 
increase  in  the  number  of  centres  for 
preschool  children,  there  is  a  general 
tendency  to  economise  in  this  kind  of 
marginal  provision.  In  Denmark,  the 
creches  have  become  so  expensive 
that  low-paid  women  can  no  longer 
use  them.  Collective  provisions,  says 
Renate  Bookhagen,  are  only  to  be 
expected  in  a  capitalist  system  when 
women  will  be  so  much  absorbed  by 
wage  labour  that  the  reproduction  of 
labour  power  runs  into  danger.21 
Provisions  are  always  minimal  and 
very  vulnerable  —  as  is  the  whole 
'soft  sector':  education,  health, 
welfare  work.  It  is  in  short  the  kind 
of  work  that  can  immediately  be 
replaced  by  the  housewife's  labour. 

Some  Remarks  In  Conclusion 

Feminist-socialists  assume  that 
women's  position  is  not  only  deter- 


Domestic  Labour/29 


mined  by  their  possible  dependence 
on  wages,  but  by  their  position  as 
housewives  as  well.  There  is  a  dialec- 
tical relationship  between  women's 
wage  labour  and  their  domestic 
labour.  There  is  a  relationship 
between  women's  domestic  labour 
and  capital,  although  an  indirect  and 
complicated  one.  With  these  data  as  a 
basis,  the  concept  of  'the'  class 
struggle  should  be  considered  anew. 
Many  Marxists  still  maintain  that  the 
labour  movement  is  fighting  their 
battle  for  everyone,  as  opposed  to  the 
feminist  movement  which  is 
representing  only  limited  interests. 
We  are  not  of  this  opinion.  It  is  not 
only  a  matter  of  seeing  how  much 
women  can  contribute  to  The  Class 
Struggle!  It  is  also  a  matter  of  seeing 
how  much  the  labour  movement  is 
contributing  towards  women's 
liberation. 

The  socialist-feminist  perspective 
should  be  the  starting-point  for 
developing  the  strategy  of  the 
feminist  movement.  We  have  too  lit- 
tle practical  experience  as  yet  to  be 
able  to  do  this  thoroughly;  the  se- 
cond feminist  wave  is  only  about 
seven  years  old,  the  feminist-socialist 
current  is  younger  still. 

For  the  time  being,  feminist- 
socialists  will  have  to  try  and  live 
with  a  double  loyalty:  solidarity  with 
the  labour  movement  (coupled  with  a 
critical  attitude  towards  its  inherent 
sexism,  blind  spots  and  prejudices), 
and  solidarity  with  the  feminist 
movement  (with  a  critical  attitude 
toward  the  currents  that  can  only 
see  socialism  as  a  liberation  of  men).

'Discussions  on  domestic  labour  are  in  fulL

New  Left  Review.  In  the  U.S.  the  magazines,

Juliet  Mitchell  had  written  "Women;  the

(Nov.-Dec,  1966),  11-37.  This  article  was  the 
basis  for  her  subsequent  book,  Woman's 
Estate.  Mitchell  took  the  view  that  the  crux  of 
women's  oppression  lay  in  the  fact  that 
women  are  excluded  from  production.  She 
argued  that  they  were  superfluous  at  home  as 
well  and  it  is  their  marginality  which  stands  in 
the  way  of  their  emancipation.  Benston 
criticizes  this  view.

5One  example  of  the  labour  intensive 
character  of  women's  work  is  pre-school  child 
care.  Several  authors  have  calculated  that, 
given  the  British  government's  standards  for 
the  ratio  of  nursery  staff  to  children  (one  to 
five),  and  an  average  family  of  one  and  a  half 
children  per  mother,  socialization  of  childcare 
would  mean  that  at  least  30%  of  the  women 
then  free  to  do  paid  work  in  other  fields  would 
have  to  do  professional  child  care.  The 
twenty-four  hour  service  of  mothers  is  not 
even  mentioned.  Susan  Himmelweit,  Jean

it  dispels  the  mist  hanging  over  the  mountains,  the  valleys

We  too  are  worker  soldiers. 

No  longer  just  wives  of  people's  heroes 

we  too  are  people's  heroes. 
And  when  the  fortresses  of  obsolete  time  are  smashed 
and  worker's  power  stands  proudly  in  our  land 
we  shall  no  longer  only  tend  the  graves

Women  in  the  Guinea-Bisseau 

Revolution 


By  STEPHANIE  URDANG 

photographs  by  Stephanie  Urdang 

Editor's  Introduction 

Against  a  backdrop  of  Portuguese 
oppressive  taxation,  forced  labor,  an 
illiteracy  rate  of  99  percent,  and  the 
utter  absence  of  social  services, 
PAIGC,  the  African  Party  for  the 
Independence  of  Guinea  and  Cape 
Verde,  was  founded  secretly  in  1956. 
Ultimately,  the  organization  shifted 
its  mobilizing  focus  from  the  workers 
in  towns  to  the  peasants  —  95  percent 
of  the  population  —and,  under  the 
leadership  of  Amilcar  Cabral,  also 
trained  young  cadres  in  Conakry,  the 
capital  of  neighboring  Guinea.  By 
January  1963,  the  guerilla  war  began, 
and  some  IIV2  years  later,  PAIGC 
had  liberated  two-thirds  of  the 
territory  of  Guinea-Bissau. 

In  September,  1974,  the  African 
Party  for  the  Independence  of  Guinea 
and  Cape  Verde  (PAIGC),  took  over 
the  government  of  the  new  Republic 
of  Guinea-Bissau.  For  the  first  time 
in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  a  war  of 
liberation  forced  a  colonial  power  to 
withdraw.  But  more  than  guerrilla 
victories     distinguish     PAIGC 

This  is  a  shortened  version  of  an 
article  to  be  published  in  Spring, 
1978,  in  the  Review  of  African

(together  with  MPLA  and  FRELIMO, 
the  revolutionary  forces  of  Angola 
and  Mozambique  respectively),  from 
other  African  independence 
movements:  PAIGC  aims  to  build  a 
society  based  on  mass  participation 
of  the  people  and  on  eradication  of  all 
forms  of  exploitation,  whether  on  the 
basis  of  race,  ethnic  group,  religion  or 
sex. 

The  successes  of  PAIGC  can  best 
be  measured  by  the  way  in  which  the 
masses  of  the  people  participated  in 
that  armed  struggle,  the  way  in 
which  the  fundamentals  of  the  state 
were  built,  and,  most  importantly, 
the  way  in  which  a  new  woman  and  a 
new  man  began  to  emerge  out  of  the 
revolutionary  experience.  In  this  con- 
text, emphasis  on  the  liberation  of 
women  can  be  looked  at  in  more 
detail. 

Portuguese  exploitation  of  the  area 
began  five  hundred  years  ago,  with 
the  highly  lucrative  slave  trade.  But 
the  Portuguese  completed  domina- 
tion of  Guinea-Bissau  only  in  the  late 
1920s  when,  with  the  rise  of  fascism 
in  Portugal,  their  methods  became 
brutal  in  the  extreme.  Guinea-Bissau 
was  not  blessed  with  the  vast  mineral 
resources  of  Angola  and  Mozam- 
bique. Moreover,  its  small  size  and 
difficult    climate    discouraged    the 


Women  in  the  Guinea-Bisseau  Revolution/33 


colonizers  from  establishing  large 
plantations  with  forced  labor. 
Instead,  they  extracted  its  wealth  by 
heavy  taxes  and  forced  the  people  to 
cultivate  peanuts  on  their  own  land. 
In  order  to  pay  taxes,  peasants  traded 
their  peanuts,  rice  and  palm  oil  to 
Portuguese  stores  at  arbitrarily-set, 
rock-bottom  prices.  This  concentra- 
tion on  peanuts  as  the  cash  crop 
weakened  the  peoples'  already  fragile 
subsistence  on  rice.  Without 
adequate  labor  to  produce  both,  they 
grew  less  rice  and  became  more  im- 
poverished with  the  flourishing  of 
political  repression. 

To  quote  Cabral,  "National  libera- 
tion, war  on  colonialism,  building  of 
peace  and  progress,  independence  — 
all  that  will  remain  meaningless  for 
the  people  unless  it  brings  a  real  im- 
provement in  conditions  of  life." 

The  Portuguese  colonialist 
presented  a  visible  and  common 
enemy.  During  the  war,  differences 
of  religion,  ethnic  group  and  sex  were 
submerged  in  a  sense  of  national  uni- 
ty. But  the  involvement  of  women  in 
the  revolution  was  a  goal  from  the 
onset,  not  an  afterthought  brought 
about  through  necessity. 

Mobilizers  went  into  the  coun- 
tryside in  1960;  they  spoke  of  the 
need  for  women  to  participate  equal- 
ly in  the  revolution  and  thus  end 
their  own  dual  exploitation.  A 
PAIGC  directive  of  the  early  '60s 
states:  "defend  the  rights  of  women, 
respect  and  make  others  respect 
women  (whether  as  children,  young 
girls  or  adults),  but  persuade  the 
women  of  our  country  that  their 
liberation  must  be  their  own  achieve- 
ment on  the  basis  of  their  work, 
dedication  to  the  Party,  self-respect, 
personality  and  decisiveness  toward 


everything  that  can  act  against  their 
dignity."1 

Armed  struggle  was  never  viewed 
as  the  final  stage  of  the  revolution. 
Therefore,  the  concept  of  equality 
was  integrated  into  the  ideology  of 
PAIGC  at  its  inception,  and  then  was 
put  into  practice  in  numerous  notable 
ways  which  would  have  been  con- 
sidered extraneous  by  mere 
nationalists,  who,  traditionally,  have 
given  women  responsibility  only 
when  responding  to  some  specific 
necessity  of  a  guerilla  war. 

Women  in  the  Revolution 

From  the  beginning  of  political 
mobilization  for  the  war  of  liberation, 
the  need  to  liberate  women  was  an 
explicit  and  integral  part  of  the 
overall  revolution:  "Our  revolution 
will  not  be  successful  unless  it  ensures 
the  full  participation  of  women,"  said 
Amilcar  Cabral,  founder  of  PAIGC. 
Carmen  Pereira,  one  of  the 
organization's  top  leaders,  affirmed 
these  ideas  when  she  said,  "In 
Guinea-Bissau,  we  say  that  women 
are  fighting  against  two  colonialisms 
—  one  against  the  Portuguese,  the 
other  against  men."  In  order  to 
achieve  that  emancipation,  PAIGC 
believed  that  an  ongoing  struggle 
must  be  waged  by  the  women 
themselves;  their  liberation  was 
never  seen  as  something  that  would 
conveniently  be  realized  along  with 
the  coming  of  independence. 

A  PAIGC  document  states,  "In  our 
country,  women  have  almost  always 
been  kept  out  of  political  affairs,  of 
decisions  concerning  the  life  which 
they  nonetheless  support,  thanks  to 
their  anonymous  daily  work."  2 
Regardless  of  considerable  diversity

Women  still  carry  the  major  burden  for  production  and  preparation  of  food.  Women  in  a 
village  in  the  south  of  independent  Guinea-Bissau. 


in  religion  and  ethnicity,  Guinea- 
Bissau  women  were  inevitably 
responsible  for  well  over  half  of  the 
agricultural  work  and  for  all  the 
village  work  —  cleaning,  washing, 
minding  children,  cooking. 


Maria  Sa,  a  member  of  a  sector 
committee  in  the  south,  spoke  about 
this:  "You  want  to  know  how  we 
women  suffered?"  she  asked.  "First, 
it  was  the  women  who  pounded,  it 
was  the  women  who  fished,  it  was 


Guinea-Bisseau  Revolution/35 


the  women  who  cooked  for  the  men. 

"In  addition  to  all  of  this,  if  his 
clothes  were  dirty,  it  was  we  women 
who  washed  them.  Nice  and  clean. 
Because  if  the  man  walked  into  the 
village  wearing  dirty  clothes  and  peo- 
ple saw  him  like  that,  who  did  it 
reflect  on?  Why,  the  women!  Not  the 
men.  We  do  not  like  this  or  want  this. 
All  these  things  are  ways  in  which 
women  suffered.  As  for  the  men,  the 
only  thing  they  did  was  till  the  land. 
Once  the  men  tilled  the  land  and  the 
rice  began  to  grow,  we  were  then 
responsible  for  everything  after  that. 
The  women  alone  harvested  the  rice, 
and  we  had  to  transport  it  without 
their  help  to  the  village. 

"This,  I  tell  you,  is  how  all  women 
were  suffering." 

Needless  to  add,  men's  work  also 
brought    more    status    and    more 


leisure.  Women  were  expected  to 
defer  even  to  men  in  their  own  age 
groups.  And  almost  without  excep- 
tion, men  were  responsible  for  the 
decision-making  process,  whether 
they  were  chiefs  or  elders.  Women 
did  not  accept  this  situation  without 
question,  but  they  could  do  little 
within  the  traditional3  society  to 
change  it. 

Nevertheless,  at  first  few  women 
attended  the  mobilization  meetings. 
To  make  sure  that  at  least  a  few  did, 
representatives  were  chosen  from  each 
village  to  report  to  the  others  at  home. 
Female  participation  grew  slowly; 
Bwetna  N'dubi,  regional  deputy  to 
the  National  Assembly,  was  one  of 
the  first  of  these  participating  pea- 
sant women:  "I  first  heard  about 
women's  rights  at  the  beginning  of 
mobilization,"   she   told  me.   "I   un-

derstood  what  was  being  said  im- 
mediately —  that  equality  is  necessary 
and  possible.  Today,  I  work  together 
with  men,  having  more  responsibility 
than  many  men.  This  is  not  only  true 
for  me.  I  understand  that  I  have  to 
fight  together  with  other  women 
against  the  domination  of  men.  But 
we  have  to  fight  twice,  once  to  con- 
vince women  and  the  second  time  to 
convince  men,  that  women  have  to 
have  the  same  rights  as  men."  She 
was  a  member  of  the  first  elected 
village  council,  established  soon  after 
the  area  had  been  liberated,  as  a 
means  of  replacing  the  traditional 
male  elders  and  chiefs,  and  as  a  way 
to  carry  out  party  work,  handle  the 
daily  organization  of  life  in  the 
village,  and  to  provide  support  for 
the  war.  PAIGC  had  earlier  stipulated 
that  at  least  two  of  the  five  members 
of  the  new  council  be  women,  and  to 
circumvent  male  resistance,  had 
made  the  women  councilors  respon- 
sible for  the  supply  of  rice  for  the 
guerrillas.  As  an  extension  of 
traditional  work  over  which  women 
already  had  considerable  control  — 
the  provision  of  funds  —  this  role  for 
women  was  readily  accepted  by  the 
men,  and  thus  the  integration  of 
women  into  a  decision-making  body 
was  achieved,  and  brought  with  it 
recognition  and  increased  status  for 
women. 

Women  did  not  play  an  equal  role 
in  the  military,  however.  At  the 
beginning  of  the  war,  many  fought  in 
the  national  militia.  But  when  the 
guerrillas  were  reorganized  to  combat 
a  fiercer  level  of  fighting,  women 
were  encouraged  to  join  the  nursing 
corps  or  to  operate  radios.  PAIGC 
reasoned  that  since  there  were  more 
than  enough  men  available  for  the 


Army,  the  situation  in  Guinea-Bissau 
was  unlike  that  in  Mozambique  and 
Vietnam,  for  instance,  and  that  hence 
it  was  not  necessary  for  women  to 
take  part  in  armed  combat.  In  addi- 
tion, PAIGC  decided  that  over- 
coming traditional  opposition  to 
recruiting  women  as  regular  soldiers 
would  be  a  protracted  process  which 
would  slow  down  the  war.  Therefore, 
it  carried  out  the  fight  in  the  liberated 
zones  instead,  where  time  was  on  the 
side  of  the  guerrilla  forces  and  where 
improved  conditions,  directly  at- 
tributable to  PAIGC,  created  a 
favorable  atmosphere  for  change. 
(Toward  the  end  of  the  war,  women 
soldiers  were  again  being  trained,  but 
peace  came  before  they  could  see  ac- 
tion.) 

The  question  of  women  in  the 
military,  however,  should  be  seen  in  a 
broader  context.  Again,  PAIGC 
emphasized  that  the  war  was  only  a 
transitory  phase  in  the  building  of  a 
new  society:  "There  is  no  point  to 
our  struggle  if  our  only  goal  is  to 
drive  out  the  Portuguese.  We  want  to 
drive  out  the  Portuguese  and  build  a 
new  society  ....  Every  man  and 
woman  must  learn  that  work  is  their 
first  duty,  and  that  workers  in  the 
country  are  useful  to  the  cause  .... 
The  armed  struggle  is  very  impor- 
tant, but  the  most  important  thing  of 
all  is  an  understanding  of  our 
people's  situation.  Our  people  sup- 
port the  armed  struggle.  We  must 
assure  them  that  those  who  bear  arms 
are  the  sons  of  our  people,  and  that 
arms  are  no  better  than  the  tools  of 
labor.  Between  one  man  carrying  a 
gun  and  another  carrying  a  tool,  the 
more  important  of  the  two  is  the  man 
with  the  tool."4 

Nonetheless,  the  fact  that  women 


Guinea-Bisseau  Revolution/37 


were  not  armed  may  be  potentially 
problematical:  guns  and  power  are 
often  equated.  It  is  to  be  hoped  that 
women's  increased  vigilance  against 
men's  attempts  to  dominate  them  will 
counteract  the  fact  that  they  have  not 
been  armed. 

The  Liberated  Zones 

Teodora  Gomes,  a  Regional 
Political  Commissar  in  the  South 
Front  during  the  war,  spoke  of  the 
continuing  need  to  fight  sexist  at- 
titudes: "It  is  one  of  the  aspects  of 
our  society  that  has  been  present,  still 
is  present  and  will  continue  to  be  pre- 
sent for  a  long  time.  Men  have  very 
particular  ideas  about  women.  At  the 
beginning  of  the  struggle,  when 
women  and  men  first  began  working 
together,  the  men  brought  with  them 
these  ideas  from  their  previous 
experience.  They  found  it  difficult  to 
regard  women  as  comrades  or  to  treat 
them  with  the  respect  due  to  them  — 
as  persons  equal  in  the  struggle  and 
working  for  the  same  goal  .  .  .  We 
continue  to  struggle  very  hard 
against  this,  and,  I  can  say,  there  has 
been  a  very  perceptible  change  over 
the  years.  Nonetheless,  we  cannot 
deny  that  these  problems  still  exist, 
despite  our  efforts." 

Of  the  many  changes  now 
transforming  the  lives  of  peasant 
women,  however,  one  of  the  most 
important  is  the  firm  stand  PAIGC 
has  taken  against  customs  detrimen- 
tal to  women:  "Oppose  without 
violence  all  prejudicial  customs,  the 
negative  aspects  of  the  beliefs  and 
traditions  of  our  people,"  stated  a 
Party  directive  which  addressed 
forced  marriage,  women's  lack  of 
recourse  to  divorce,  and  polygyny. 

The  question  of  forced  marriage, 


taken  up  when  mobilization  first 
began,  was  a  regular  theme  of 
speeches  at  mass  peasant  meetings. 
The  response  of  many  young  women 
about  to  enter  such  marriages  was 
immediate:  they  joined  the  Party,  and 
went  to  work  in  the  guerrilla  bases 
away  from  their  villages.  Thus,  by 
providing  new  structures  to  which 
women  could  escape,  PAIGC  laid  the 
practical  foundation  on  which  Gui- 
nean  women  could  begin  to  change 
their  subordinate  position. 

There  was  a  similar  response  to  the 
question  of  divorce.  Women  who  had 
been  forced  to  marry  could  now  leave 
their  husbands.  Before  the  mobiliza- 
tion, it  was  extremely  unusual  for  a 
woman  to  be  given  permission  to 
return  to  her  parental  family.  If  she 
did,  she  lost  all  access  to  her  children. 
These  cases  were  later  heard  by  the 
elected  people's  courts.  And  since 
they  invariably  decided  in  the 
woman's  favor,  by  the  end  of  the 
war,  the  old  practices  were  virtually 
nonexistent  in  the  liberated  zones. 

The  process  of  bringing  polygyny 
to  an  end  was  more  complex  and  is 
still  not  completed.  Total  reversal  of 
this  custom  will  take  much  longer 
because  it  is  basic  to  the  social  struc- 
ture and  economy  of  the  village:  if  a 
man  has  two  or  three  wives,  he  has 
more  help  in  the  rice  fields.  The  Party 
has  understood  that  it  cannot  simply 
outlaw  retrograde  customs,  or  the 
people  will  rebel.  This  view  is  that 
the  process  of  transformation  begins 
with  political  education,  but  that  ul- 
timately, the  economy  must  be 
changed  so  as  to  remove  the  con- 
ditions which  have  given  rise  to  such 
social  practices. 

The  most  striking  example  of 
PAIGC's  attempt  to  change  sexist  at- 


38/Quest 


titudes  and  protect  women  was  its  ac- 
tion for  battered  women.  This  regula- 
tion was  put  into  immediate  effect  by 
means  of  a  special  emergency 
procedure.  An  injured  wife  can  now 
report  her  case  to  the  Commission  of 
Justice;  if  she  can  show  marks  on  her 
body  from  a  beating,  her  husband 
will  immediately  be  jailed  for  a 
minimum  of  48  hours. 

The  Commissioner  of  Justice  com- 
mented of  pre-mobilization  Guinea, 
"The  situation  was  scandalous.  Every 


single  day  wives  would  be  beaten  so 
badly  that  some  even  died.  Men  op- 
pressed by  the  colonialists  took  out 
their  frustrations  on  their  wives  and 
their  children.  It  was  an  urgent  situa- 
tion that  had  to  be  dealt  with  strong- 
ly. We  [now]  have  to  show  these  men 
that  we  are  serious  about  changing 
those  attitudes.  Men  must  learn  to 
respect  women,  and  if  they  do  not, 
we  [shall]  have  to  take  action  to  com- 
bat [their  reluctance]." 

At   the   meeting   of    the   National 


Teodora  Gomes  addressed  a  meeting  in  a  small  town  in  independent  Guinea-Bissau  that  was  un- 
der Portuguese  control  during  the  war. 


Guinea-Bisseau  Revolution/39 


Assembly  in  May,  1974,  six  new  laws 
were  passed,  three  protecting  the 
rights  of  women.  One  laid  down  con- 
ditions for  divorce,  making  the  law 
national  in  scope.  Another,  elimi- 
nating the  categories  of  legiti- 
mate and  illegitimate  offspring, 
made  a  father  equally  responsible  for 
the  support  of  all  his  children.  A 
third  law  gave  equal  status  to  "legal" 
and  to  "common-law"  marriages. 
These  three  laws  are  seen  as 
mechanisms  for  developing  a  greater 
respect  and  sense  of  responsibility  on 
the  part  of  men  toward  women. 
PAIGC  anticipates  that  a  man  who 
cannot  simply  "forget"  common-law 
wives  and  children  is  likely  to  weigh 
his  actions  toward  women  carefully. 

Independence 

The  number  of  women  in  positions 
of  leadership  and  responsibility  is 
small  but  substantial  —  given  that  it 
began  with  zero.  Francisca  Pereira,  a 
member  of  the  Superior  Council  for 
the  Fight,  joined  the  party  as  a  young 
adult  and  had  to  fight  sexism  con- 
tinuously. She  says,  "Now,  though, 
difficulties  seldom  occur  between 
comrades  working  together.  Women 
with  positions  in  the  Party,  like 
Theodora  [Gomes]  and  myself,  have 
their  opinions  and  decisions  taken 
seriously  and  with  respect.  But  still, 
this  is  not  always  the  case  for  the 
younger  women  who  are  only  begin- 
ning to  work  with  the  Party." 

Several  new  efforts  to  assure  the 
continuing  struggle  against  patri- 
archy have  been  established. 
One  such,  the  Organization  of 
Women  established  a  few  months 
after  independence,  is  led  by  a  ten- 
member    Commission    of    Women 


which  ranks  as  a  ministry  of  the 
government.  Each  region  elects  a 
five-member  committee,  whose 
president  works  closely  with  its 
regional  Commissioner.  The  latter 
travels  frequently  to  discuss 
problems  with  committee  members 
and  to  address  mass  meetings.  Satu 
Djassi,  a  young  peasant  Com- 
missioner, exemplified  the  political 
orientation  of  the  Women's 
Organization  in  a  speech  she  gave  at 
a  village  near  the  Conakry  border,  to 
villagers  who  had  only  returned  from 
refuge  in  Conakry  after  the  war. 

Satu  began  her  speech  by 
emphasizing  the  need  to  work  hard  at 
rebuilding  the  country  and  en- 
couraging women  to  help  with  the 
building  of  houses,  work  that  has 
traditionally  been  done  by  the  men: 
"If  the  wife  does  not  help  to  build  the 
house,  your  husband  can  say,  'This  is 
my  house,  not  yours',  and,  as  is  done 
so  often,  he  can  send  you  away.  But 
if  the  husband  and  wife  share  in  the 
building  of  the  house,  then  it  belongs 
to  both.  One  does  not  have  more 
rights  than  the  other.  Maybe  the  men 
think  they  are  stronger  than  women 
and  that  they  can.  still  send  their 
wives  away.  But  no  man  is  stronger 
than  the  State,  and  the  People's  Court 
can  intervene.  Men  must  respect  us 
and  treat  us  as  equals. 

"If  a  woman  thinks:  "No,  I  am  in- 
ferior," then  there  is  little  we  can  do 
to  change  the  situation.  This  is  not 
correct.  We  women  are  not  inferior. 
We  can  do  what  men  do.  Some 
women  work  harder  than  men.  There 
is  no  work  that  is  just  for  men  or  just 
for  women. 

"Historically,  the  women  of 
Guinea-Bissau  participated  in  the 
struggle.  Through  this  participation 


40/Quest 


we  learnt  that  we  are  not  inferior. 
Women,  I  am  asking  you  to  hold 
onto  what  you  gained  during  the  war 
and  to  continue  to  struggle  for 
equality.  Do  not  allow  the  rebuilding 
of  our  society  to  go  ahead  and  leave 
you  behind. 

"The  colonialists  were  against  us, 
they  oppressed  us.  Men  and  women. 
But  then  our  men  oppressed  us  on 
top  of  this.  If  your  husband  chose  to, 
he  would  also  beat  you.  That  is  why  I 
say  we  had  two  colonialisms  on  our 
hands:  we  had  the  Portuguese  in  our 
country  and  our  husbands  in  our 
house. 

"But  the  problem  of  the  co- 
lonialism in  our  own  homes  is  a 
more  difficult  one.  We  are  all  part  of 
the  same  family.  Our  husband  lives 
in  our  house  and  is  the  father  of  our 
children.  But  it  is  the  women  who 
care  for  the  children,  who  know  them 
best.  Fathers  say  they  have  other 
things  to  think  about.  When  the 
children  grow  up,  suddenly  the 
father  says  proudly:  This  is  my 
daughter,  not  yours'.  From  that  time 
on  he  pays  much  attention  to  her.  But 
we  know  about  the  marriages  that 
these  daughters  are  expected  to  make. 
The  father  is  doing  this  because  her 
marriage  will  profit  him.  If  a  mother 
or  daughter  is  unhappy  about  the 
husband  that  has  been  chosen,  there 
is  nothing  they  can  do. 

"This  cannot  be,  comrades,"  Satu 
said,  addressing  the  men,  "we  must 
all  decide  together  what  our  daughter 
is  going  to  do.  This  practice  must 
stop  once  and  for  all.  If  you  are 
talking  about  freedom,  then  it  must 
exist  in  your  home  and  not  just  out- 
side. As  Amilcar  Cabral  said,  'We 
must  leave  these  detrimental 
traditions    behind    us.    You    must 


respect  your  wife  and  daughter  and 
not  practice  your  colonial  ideas  in  the 
family.'  " 

An  older  peasant  women,  Mariama 
Camara,  who  had  lived  in  Cacine,  a 
small  town  turned  into  a  fortified 
camp  by  the  Portuguese  army,  and 
who  had  therefore  only  come  into 
direct  contact  with  PAIGC  and  its 
ideology  after  independence,  spoke 
about  the  role  of  women  in  Guinea- 
Bissau,  and  showed  her  comprehen- 
sion of  the  problems: 

"The  Portuguese  colonialists  op- 
pressed us.  They  smashed  us.  And 
for  women  it  was  particularly  bad. 
The  men  were  oppressed  by  the  Por- 
tuguese and  they,  in  turn,  oppressed 
the  women.  So  we  were  oppressed 
twice.  Now  at  meetings,  women  want 
to  stand  up  and  speak  their  minds 
freely.  Many  women  want  to  express 
their  own  independent  personalities 
but  they  are  afraid  of  the  men.  And 
the  men  think  we  do  not  speak 
because  we  do  not  understand  what 
is  going  on.  This  is  not  so.  We  un- 
derstand only  too  well  the  situation. 
We  are  not  stupid.  We  are  not  in- 
ferior. But  we  do  not  speak  out 
because  they  have  oppressed  us. 

"In  order  for  our  country  to  ad- 
vance, this  must  end.  For  the  country 
to  develop,  it  must  benefit  from  both 
men  and  women.  Otherwise  the 
country  will  suffer  by  losing  our  con- 
tribution. If  this  can  change,  we  will 
advance  more  quickly  than  we  are 
doing  now.  But  it  is  not  easy.  Even 
though  our  country  has  been 
liberated,  it  does  not  mean  that  these 
attitudes,  this  mentality  can  change 
immediately.  Oh  no.  It  will  take  a 
long  time  to  free  both  women  and 
men  from  these  attitudes."

represent  two  aspects  of  the  con- 
tinuing struggle  for  the  liberation  of 
women.  Satu  is  that  continuing 
process  in  action,  a  process  led  by 
women  who  gained  their  experience, 
consciousness  and  political  commit- 
ment through  the  armed  struggle 
phase  of  the  revolution.  Mariama 
reveals  the  impact  that  it  is  having  on 
peasant  women  —  those  who  began 
hearing  these  words  and  concepts  for 
the  first  time  after  independence. 

Conclusion 

PAIGC  today  is  confronted  with 
the  seemingly  overwhelming  task  of 
developing  the  nation  into  a  socialist 
state.  The  priority  during  the  war 
was  the  armed  struggle,  for  nothing 
could  be  achieved  until  the  Por- 
tuguese colonialists  were  forced  from 
their  land.  The  priority  now  is  to 
build  a  viable  economy,  based  on 
agriculture,  in  order  to  develop  the 
country  along  a  revolutionary  and 
socialist  path.  In  the  meantime,  the 
liberation  of  women  has  become  one 
of  the  fundamental  aspects  of  the 
continuing  revolution.  While 
national  reconstruction  has  mush- 
roomed to  include  many  facets 
of  development  that  could  not  be 
started  in  the  forests  during  the  war, 
it  faces  a  general  lack  of  cadres,  and  a 
critical  lack  of  women  cadres. 
Despite  such  obstacles,  there  are  no 
signs  that  women  are  being  en- 
couraged to  return  to  their  homes  and 
to  traditional  work;  all  indications 
point  to  the  opposite.  Creation  of  the 
material  basis  for  socialism  brings 
with   it  the  best  conditions   for   the 


emancipation  of  women,  a  goal 
which  in  the  eyes  of  the  PAIGC,  is  an 
integral  part  of  the  revolutionary 
process. 

This  is  a  transitional  and  difficult 
stage  in  the  history  of  the  revolution. 
There  are  many  concrete  plans,  many 
projections,  many  hopes  and  dreams 
for  the  future.  PAIGC,  to  use 
Amilcar  Cabral's  words,  is  "taking 
the  way  of  socialism/'- What  we  are 
witnessing  the  few  years  after  in- 
dependence are  the  first  tentative 
steps  by  which  the  people  and  the 
government  of  Guinea-Bissau  are 
trying  to  reach  that  goal.

BRAZIL 


O  Homosexual  Brasilero 

The  following  is  taken  from  an  un- 
published manuscript,  entitled,  "O 
Homosexual  Brasilero,"  written  by 
Graca  Maria  Aires  Montini  of  Brazil 
and  translated  by  Victor  Harris. 

Brazil  is  a  large  developing  country 
consisting  of  different  ethnic  groups 
as  well  as  different  customs.  After 
the  appearance  of  lesbian  and 
homosexual  groups  in  Europe  and 
America,  claiming  the  legitimacy  of 
their  rights,  Brazilian  homosexuals 
began  to  organize  for  support.  Many 
are  no  longer  ashamed  of  their  "con- 
dition", nor  are  they  looking  for  a 
way  to  cure  themselves. 

The  homosexual  presence 
manifests  itself  in  various  ways  in  the 
different  regions,  with  greatest 
acceptance  concentrated  in  the  large 
cities  such  as  Rio,  Sao  Paulo,  Porto 
Alegre,  Salvador,  Belo  Horizonte, 
Recife,   Brasilia    and    a   few   others. 


With  the  exception  of  some  par- 
ticular circles,  above  all  those  of  the 
artist  and  a  small  sector  of  the  youth 
in  the  large  cities,  there  still  exists  a 
strong  anti-homosexual  prejudice 
that  has  been  little  affected  by  the 
liberal  tradition  of  the  customs  and 
language.  Even  today,  one  hears  and 
reads  rude  comments  and  debasing 
jokes  about  homosexuals  on  radio 
and  television  and  in  the  press.  In  the 
media  a  homosexual  person  can  be 
accepted,  especially  if  she  or  he  is 
someone  famous  from  the  literary 
world,  the  theatre  or  the  movie 
world,  but  this  acceptance  is  merely  a 
"face-to-face"  one  because  otherwise 
the  typical  jests  continue. 

Homosexuals  who  are  aware  of 
themselves  as  homosexuals  may 
number  as  much  as  7  to  8%  of  the 
population  but  they  remain  largely 


In  Brief:  Brazil,  France,  Israel  &  an  International/43 


unknown  to  the  "custom  censors" 
(sociologists  and  psychologists)  who 
only  see  in  the  homosexual  a  case  to 
be  dealt  with  by  the  police  or  a 
"deranged  one"  who  should  be 
castrated,  or  a  sick  soul  to  be  treated. 
Brazilian  law  does  not  provide 
specific  sanctions  against 
homosexuality  itself,  but  even  with 
this  fact  the  person  with  homosexual 
tendencies  is  no  less  a  victim  of  social 
discrimination.  The  prejudice  she  or 
he  faces  is  similar  to  racial  prejudice. 
It  should  be  said  here  that  the 
liberalness  of  the  language  which  was 
mentioned  earlier  has  also  con- 
tributed to  the  creation  of  highly 
pejorative  words  to  label  the  lesbian, 
such  as  "big  shoe"  (sapatao)  in 
carioca  (Rio)  slang.  We  can  recognize 
that  this  expression  was  created  by 
men  and  reflects  a  "macho"  resent- 
ment, a  frustration  of  the  Brazilian 
man  himself  against  what  is  seen  as 
the  dominant  character  in  the  lesbian 
pair.  This  also  shows  the  ignorance 
prevalent  since  in  many  homosexual 
relationships,  above  all  between 
women,  there  isn't  one  who  plays  the 


dominant  or  passive  role,  but  instead 
an  equality,  giving  to  both  in- 
dividuals the  same  satisfaction. 

The  lesbian  woman  in  Brazil  facing 
the  repression  of  an  anti-homosexual 
culture  may  still  be  considered  less 
neurotic  than  a  man  in  a  similar 
situation.  It's  easier  for  her  to  accept 
the  inner  reality  of  physical  attraction 
for  a  member  of  the  same  sex.  Guilt 
for  the  woman  still  seems  strongest  in 
the  heterosexual  relationship,  where 
the  question  of  the  profound  taboos 
around  virginity  are  concentrated. 

FRANCE 

Feminist  Theory  in  France 

The  following  is  a  brief  selection 
from  an  article  entitled,  "Reflections 
on  Feminism,"  by  Suzanne  Blaise, 
one  of  the  founders  of  the  Trench 
Feminist  Party  Union  in  1975  and 
who  is  currently  working  on  a  book 
demythologizing  the  relations 
between  mothers  and  children.  We 
want  to  give  wider  circulation  to  her 


44/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978

ideas  and  to  give  some  indication  of 
the  work  being  done  by  feminists  in 
France.  This  selection  was  translated 
by  Betty  J.  Powell  We  are  working 
on  a  translation  of  the  whole  article 
and  will  publish  more  of  her  argu- 
ment in  a  future  issue  of  Quest. 

Even  before  we  have  clearly 
defined  this  new  concept  "feminism", 
we  are  asked  to  ponder  the  question 
of  its  assimilation  of  male-identified 
concepts,  such  as  humanism  or 
economism.  Now,  granted,  we  have 
been  taught,  we  women,  that  is,  that 
to  effect  the  best  cuisine  is  essentially 
the  art  of  transforming  leftovers.  But 
one  would  fiercely  hope  that  in  this 
context  all  the  resources  of  our  in- 
tellect and  will  remain  powerless  to 
spice  up  the  dubious  taste  of  certain 
foods  —  goods  which  have  not  in- 
sured the  best  survival  of 
humankind. 

In  considering  the  issue  of 
assimilation,  what  is  disclosed  is  a 
kind  of  cosmic  panic,  an  unconscious 
fear  of  engaging  in  the  search  for  our 
own  political  identity,  and  a  tendency 
to  take  refuge  under  the  patriarchal 
cloak  of  what  is  labeled  "certain."  It 
reveals  a  profound  ignorance  or  a 
destructive  will  to  assume  that 
feminism  would  resurrect  certain 
idealistic  or  economistic  visions 
which  are  synonymous  with  the 
word  hypocrisy.  We  are  provided 
the  evidence  every  day.  Humanism 
and  economism  (which  pretend  to 
pursue  the  same  goal)  are  both  suited 
to  be  compromised,  however,  and 
capable  of  duping  women  in  the 
name  of  affective  values  or  economic 
imperatives.  In  the  general  scheme  of 
things  their  universal  failure  as  alter- 
natives is  patent.  Material  progress 
alone  has  not  succeeded  in  creating 


human  happiness;  nor  have  certain 
abstract  visions  of  Man  or  Woman 
when  considered  out  of  their  social 
and  political  contexts. 

Feminism  is  above  all  good  sense 
and  critical  sense.  It  is  a  con- 
sciousness that  cannot  align  itself 
with  any  positions  without 
examining  and  evaluating  them.  It 
challenges  all  prevailing  theories  and 
ideologies  that  fail  to  include  the 
reality  of  feminism  in  their  analyses. 

Suzanne  Blaise  begins  her  analysis 
with  these  words.  She  goes  on  to 
demonstrate  the  inadequacy  for 
feminists  of  both  liberal  and  Marxist 
humanism.  She  then  turns  to  the  in- 
adequacy of  economism,  defined  as 
the  belief  in  the  primacy  of  the 
productive  forces  as  the  motor  of 
human  progress  (the  capitalist  view) 
or  the  motor  of  revolution  (the 
socialist  version  of  economic  deter-

minism).  Blaise  concludes  her  argu- 
ment with  this  call  for  the  autonomy 
of  feminism: 

Woman,  who  has  been  denied 
either  a  soul  or  an  identity  is  today  in 
pursuit  of  both.  And  she  will  find  it 
in  political,  economic,  and  emotional 
independence.  She  will  reclaim  it 
through  the  autonomy  of  her  efforts 
and  her  unique  means  of  struggle. 

Feminism  can  be  nothing  less  than 
free  and  critical  thought ....  Women 
have  accumulated,  in  their  silence, 
which  has  endured  for  centuries  now, 

'  "   t 


a  formidable  critical  sense  which  no 
amount  of  obstruction  will, 
henceforth,  blunt  or  sway  •.  .  .  . 
Feminism  and  politics  have  always 
been  inseparable.  There  is,  for  exam- 
ple, the  feminism  long  familiar  to  us 
now  which  never  ceases  to  lay  claim 
to  its  rights  —  these  rights  which  can 


only  become  effective  within  a  cer- 
tain socio-economic  context,  rights 
we  must  struggle  for  in  the  here  and 
now.  These  rights,  so  basic  yet  so  for- 
mally cast  in  bourgeois  democratic 
terms,  must  become  real,  must  be 
clearly  enunciated  and  loudly 
proclaimed  and  defended  before  all 
the  world. 


ISRAEL 


Israeli  Women: 
Equality  or  Mythology 

This  is  a  portion  of  an  article, 
"Equality  for  Israeli  Women:  Myth 
or  Reality,"  by  Rahel  Alterman, 
who  as  a  member  of  the  Israel 
Feminist  Movement  with  a  Ph.D.  in 
City  Planning  has  undertaken 
research  on  the  legal  and  parliamen- 
tarian aspects  of  women's  status  in 
Israel. 

The  Israeli  feminine  reality  is  a 
complex  mixture  of  sometimes- 
contradictory  facets,  owing  their 
origins  to  three  dimensions:  (1) 
Zionist  hopes  of  creating  a  just, 
social-democratic  society  based  on 
the  best  of  Western  liberalism;  (2) 
archaic  Jewish  traditional  religious 
customs;  (3)  the  various  sub-cultures 
of  the  ethnic  groups  (Jewish  and 
Arab)  composing  the  Israeli  mosaic. 

On  the  one  hand,  one  can  point  to 
examples  of  Israeli  legislation  that 
can  still  serve  as  models  to  many 
Western  countries  in  the  sphere  of 
equality  between  the  sexes.  As  early 
as  1951,  the  Israeli  parliament  passed 
the  Women's  Equal  Rights  Law 
which  ostensibly  assures  women 
equality  in  all  future  legislation;  three 
years    later,    it    passed    the    Female 


46/Quest

Labour  Law  which  forbids  an  em- 
ployer to  fire  a  pregnant  woman  or  a 
woman  who  has  taken  birth-leave 
of  up  to  one  year;  national  social 
security  was  provided  to  the  working 
mother  who  would  get  almost  full 
pay  during  three  months  of  post- 
birth  leave;  in  1964,  the  Male  and 
Female  Workers  (Equal  Pay)  Law  was 
enacted;  and,  of  course,  Israel  is  one 
of  the  few  western  countries  where 
women  are  conscripted  to  the  army. 
But  even  in  the  legal  sphere,  where 
Israeli  women  fare  relatively  well, 
there  are  still  barriers.  Especially 
revealing  of  the  Israeli  paradox  is  the 
Female  Labour  Law  of  1954,  which 
"protects"  women  as  semi- 
dependents.  It  forbids  women  to 
work  after  dark,  except  in  oc- 
cupations that  it  chooses  to  designate 
—  such  as  nursing,  or  waitressing  — 
which  also  happen  to  be  relatively 
low-paying,  traditionally  "feminine"

occupations.  It  also  forbids  women  to 
work  for  three  months  after  giving 
birth,  even  if  the  doctor  believes  the 
woman  to  be  in  good  health,  and 
even  if  the  woman  herself  feels  well 
enough. 


In  the  situation  regarding  marriage 
and  divorce,  traditional  Jewish 
orthodox  laws  come  into  play,  since 
this  is  the  one  area  where  religious 
law  is  the  law  of  the  land.  In  this 
realm  the  Israeli  woman  finds  herself 
powerless,  discriminated  against, 
sometimes  despised  by  the  court. 
Imagine  a  couple  beginning  their 
family  career  in  Israel.  If  the  couple 
are  both  Jewish,  the  traditional  wed- 
ding ceremony,  which  is  the  only 
ceremony  the  law  recognizes,  calls 
for  the  symbolic  purchase  of  the 
wife.  If  the  couple  happen  to  be 
Moslem  (and  then  religious  Moslem 


law  is  the  law  of  the  land),  the 
purchase  is  likely  to  be  an  actual 
transaction.  The  "merchandise" 
varies  in  price  depending  on  the 
social  class  of  the  wife,  her  health  and 
beauty,  and  her  wealth.  If  the  couple 
is  unfortunate  enough  not  to  share 
the  same  religion,  they  would 
probably  have  to  undergo  their  wed- 
ding ceremony  abroad. 

If  the  marriage  has  failed,  both  the 
Jewish  law  and  the  Moslem  law  up- 
held in  Israel  regard  the  husband  as 
the  only  one  who  can  initiate  the 
divorce  and  the  wife  must  usually 
comply.  In  extreme  situations,  the 
Jewish  Rabbi  may  go  as  far  as  to 
threaten  the  husband  with  a  jail 
sentence  if  he  does  not  give  a  divorce. 
But  if  he  chooses  to  stay  in  prison 
rather  than  comply  or  if  he  is  mental- 
ly unfit  to  dispense  a  divorce,  the 
wife  is  bound  to  him  and  cannot 
remarry.  During  the  Rabbinical  court 
hearings,  women  are  not  allowed  to 
serve  as  rabbinical  judges,  and  even 
their  status  as  witnesses  is  often 
questioned  since  Orthodox  tradition 
has  it  that  "women  have  frivolous 
minds"  and  cannot  be  trusted  to  tell 
the  truth. 

The  paradox  lies  in  the  fact  that 
the  two  legal  spheres  —  the  relatively 
liberal  secular  laws  and  the  highly- 
archaic  religious  laws  —  have  been 
coexisting  side  by  side  for  twenty-six 
years  each  seemingly  oblivious  to  the 
existence  of  the  other.  Few  of  the  es- 
timated 75%  of  the  Israeli  population 
who  are  secular  non-religious,  see 
room  for  complaint,  although  the 
issue  of  freedom  to  marry,  often 
denied  by  religious  law,  has  recently 
become  a  public  political  issue,  but 
not  particularly  from  the  woman's 
point  of  view.

The  economic  sphere  is  no  less 
complex.  On  the  one  hand,  statistics 
show  that  Israeli  women  have 
penetrated  most  of  the  professions  to 
a  greater  extent  than  elsewhere  in  the 
Western  world.  As  many  as  70%  of 
young  professional  women  with  no 
more  than  one  child  remain  in  the 
labour  force  at  least  part-time.  But 
the  over-all  female  participation  rate 
in  the  labor  force  is  much  lower  than 
in  the  U.S.  —  only  30%  —  indicating 
that  lower-class  married  women  rare- 
ly work  outside  their  homes.  And 
even  the  professional  women  do  not 
fare  too  well:  there  is  discrimination 
in  hiring  and  advancement  for  high- 
status  jobs. 

Further,  there  is  a  40%  wage 
differential  between  men  and  women 
on  the  average,  which  can  be  at- 
tributed mostly  to  the  lower-paying 


occupations  where  it  is  difficult  to 
apply  the  Equal  Pay  Law.  The 
employer  conveniently  makes  it  an 
all-female  occupation  so  there  would 
be  no  male  to  serve  as  a  standard  to 
which  the  Equal  Pay  Law  could  app- 
ly. The  occupations  in  which  women 
are  the  striking  majority  are  prac- 
tically devoid  of  avenues  of  advance- 
ment. 

The  social  scene  is  perhaps  the 
most  difficult  to  outline  because  of  its 
broadness  and  complexity.  In  public 
education,  for  example,  one  can  safe- 
ly say  that  Israel  compares  well  with 
other  countries  as  far  as  early  educa- 
tion for  equality  between  the  sexes. 


But  boys  do  not  take  sewing  and 
cooking  nor  do  girls  usually  take 
carpentry.  In  short,  sex-typing  is 
almost  as  prevalent  among  Israeli 
children  as  it  is  among  European  and 
American  children.  A  similar  state- 
ment can  be  made  about  Israeli 
adults,  but  here  the  situation  would

vary  depending  on  the  ethnic  group 
in  question:  among  the  Arab  minori- 
ty and  Jews  born  in  Arab  countries 
(who  are  the  majority  of  the  popula- 
tion) women  have  a  longer  journey 
towards  equality  than  among 
western-born  Jews. 

One  of  the  factors  that  has 
probably  helped  to  create  the  myth  of 
equality  for  Israeli  women  has  been 
their  supposed  equality  in  the  Kib- 
butzim. Even  if  that  were  true,  the 
Kibbutzim  constitute  only  3%  of 
Israeli  population  (and  are  slowly 
declining).  Although  in  their  earlier 
history  there  had  been  attempts  to 
put  equality  between  the  sexes  into 


everyday  practice  (and  this  is  why 
the  collective  raising  of  children  was 
instituted),  the  Kibbutzim  of  today 
have  regressed  markedly.  Thus  Kib- 
butz   women    usually    work   in   the 


collective  kitchen,  laundry  or  child 
care,  and  all  too  often  they  are  devoid 
of  professional  advancement.  The 
Kibbutz  family  is  no  more  egalitarian 
than  the  middle-class  urban  family. 
Finally,  the  myth  that  has  perhaps 
proven  most  resistant  to  reality  is  the 
women-in-  the-army  image. 
Although  officially  women  are  con- 
scripted to  army  service  along  with 
men,  there  are  many  fewer  women  in 
the  army  than  men.  Law  and  custom 
leave  many  avenues  open  for  women 
to  stay  out:  she  may  declare  that  she 
is  religious;  she  may  get  married  and 
then  not  be  eligible  for  regular  ser- 
vice; or  she  may  lack  high  school 
education,  a  criterion  which  the  army 
has  unofficially  set  for  women  but  of 
course  not  for  men.  If  she  serves,  she 
will  usually  be  employed  in  ad- 
ministrative work,  nursing,  or 
cultural  work.  Women  are  not 
allowed  in  the  front  lines  and  are  not 
utilized  even  for  such  back-line  work 
as  vehicle  and  machine  maintenance 
where  there  is  a  severe  shortage  of 
personnel.  When  they  leave  the  ar- 
my, they  are  unlikely  to  be  called  for 
reserve  service  (so  important  in  the 
Israeli  army)  and  if  they  choose  to

make  the  army  their  career  their  ad- 
vance will  be  restricted. 

Women  in  Israel  live  in  a  complex 
society.  As  yet,  few  Israeli  women 
seem  to  be  aware  of  the  fact  that  there 
is  much  to  be  desired  in  all  spheres  of 
life  if  women  are  to  be  equal  not  only 
before  the  law,  but  also  person-to- 
person. 

An  International 


A  Feminist  International 

The  following  was  translated  by 
Nancy  Hartsock,  with  the  assistance 
of  Dahlia  Judovitz. 

Recognizing  the  strong  current  of 
feminist  aspirations  in  the  world  and 
the  common  positions  they  hold, 
groups  of  women  have  understood 
that  the  hour  has  come  to  organize 
ourselves  politically. 

It  is  from  this  perspective  that  the 
Unified  Feminist  Parties  of  France 
and  Belgium  took  the  initiative  of 
contacting  other  feminist  groups  in 
different  countries  in  order  to  set  up 
an  international  gathering. 

This  meeting  took  place  at  Mon- 
treuil,  the  19-21  of  May,  1977,  and 
included  women  from  Germany, 
Belgium,  Spain,  France  and  Israel, 
commissioned  by  their  various 
organizations.  In  the  course  of  the 
debate,  the  delegates  were  agreed  on: 

1.  the  necessity  of  a  new  form  of 
political  organization  for  women; 

2.  the  feminist  autonomy  and 
political  identity; 

3.  the  abolition  of  the  mode  of 
production  based  on  the  family  unit 
(familial  mode  of  production),  the 
basis  of  almost  all  existing  societies. 


After  thirty  hours  of  debate,  the 
first  Feminist  International  was 
created  on  the  basis  of  a  platform  un- 
animously adopted,  and  beginning 
with  this  appeal:

A.  Organization 


an 


I.   Political    Organization    of 
Exploited  and  Oppressed  Class: 

The  only  means  of  changing  the 
present  social  and  economic  structure 
is  the  organization  of  women  in  order 
to  take  political  power.  Because  of 
specific  conditions,  each  country  will 
be  the  judge  of  its  own  strategies. 

New  forms  of  organization  must 


<3 


In  Brief/51 


be  created  which  reject  hierarchy 
with  its  centralization  of  power  and 
functions.  The  structural  base  will  be 
the  feminist  group.* 

Coordination  of  member  groups 
will  be  emphasized  as  opposed  to 
centralization. 

II.  The  Member  Groups  of  the  Inter- 
national Are  Feminist  Organizations. 

They  demand  not  only  equality  of 
rights  for  men  and  women,  but 
feminist  political  autonomy  and  iden- 
tity. 

The  member  groups  of  the  Inter- 
national are  not  mixed. 

Feminism  is  its  own  political  op- 
tion —  one  which  proposes  a  global 
alternative  to  society. 

*Feminist  groups  in  the  European  con- 
text include  consciousness-raising 
groups,  but  the  term  more  directly  refers 
to  groups  involved  in  feminist  projects 
and  political  activity. 


III.  Women  Are  Subject  to  the  Op- 
pression and  Exploitation  Both  of  the 
Patriarchy  and  of  Private  Capitalism 
or  State  Capitalism  as  Practiced  in  the 
Socialist  Countries. 

The  dialectic  of  the  class  struggle 
of  women  rests  in  the  opposition 
(contradiction)  of  women  and  men. 
From  this  beginning,  this  struggle 
goes  beyond  the  struggle  of  other 
social  classes  and  ends  in  the  destruc- 
tion of  the  family-based  mode  of 
production,  the  base  of  all  existing 
societies. 

This  conception  of  feminism  con- 
stitutes the  foundation  of  the 
Feminist  International. 

B.  Objectives 

The  taking  of  power  to  make  a 
feminist  revolution  means: 
—the  destruction  of  the  family  in- 
sofar as  it  constitutes  a  unit  of 
production  which  requires  the 
exploitation  and  oppression  of  the 
woman; 

—a  new,  non-sexist  education  and  a 
new  social  decree  for  children; 
—  the  socialization  in  a  self- 
determined  way  of  domestic  work 
and  child-rearing  and  the  suppres- 
sion of  sex  roles;** 
—a  new  way  of  relating  (new  con- 
viviality); 

**"Auto-gestion"  has  been  translated 
here  as  "self-determination. "  The  French 
term  as  used  by  the  Left  in  Europe  has 
come  to  mean  more  than  "self- 
management"  which  would  be  the  literal 
translation.  It  refers  to  a  kind  of  control 
of  social  institutions  as  a  whole  by  the 
participants  in  those  institutions,  along 
with  a  sense  that  participants  will  deter- 
mine the  general  direction  as  well  as 
specific  policies  to  be  followed.

—a    recreation    of    eroticism    in    the 
direction  of  a  total  humanity  in  place 
of  a  consumer-oriented  sexuality; 
—control  of  our  bodies; 
—the  right  to  rewarding  work; 
—the  right  to  political  life; 
—the  full  participation  in  all  the  func- 
tions of  decision-making  and  control 
at    every    level    —    direct    self- 
determination    at    the    level   of    the 
enterprise,  direct  democracy  and  new 
modes   of   exercising   power   at   the 
level  of  politics,  suppression  of  the 
division  of  labor  in  the  family  as  in 
the  society. 

C.  The  Society  We  Want 

I.  The  Feminist  International  is  con- 
vinced that  the  sole  means  of 
democratic  rule  is  self-determination. 
It  considers  that  this  can  only  be  at- 
tained in  a  society  without  economic 
or  sexual  exploitation. 

II.  In  the  present  period,  self- 
determination  means  the 
autonomous  feminist  struggle  against 


all  centralized  power  —  whether 
patriarchal  or  capitalist.  A  feminist 
society  will  be  a  planned  economic 
system  after  the  self-determined 
socialization  of  domestic  work  and 
the  raising  of  children.

D.  Feminism:    A    Revolutionary 
Force 

I.  Because  it  opposes  the  patriarchy, 
the  base  of  almost  all  known 
societies,  the  Feminist  International  is 
radical  and  revolutionary. 


II.  This  I.F.  (Internationale 
Feministe)  was  founded  by  the  PFU's 
of  Germany,  Belgium,  and  France, 
and  the  Spanish  feminist  collectives 
in  Barcelona,  Madrid,  Oviedo, 
Castelon,  and  Valencia. 

III.  The  I.F.  respects  the  autonomy 
of  the  groups  of  each  participating 
country  and  remains  open  to  all 
feminist  groups  who  accept  the 
minimum  positions  of  the  Inter- 
national. 

IV.  The  I.F.  does  not  consider  the 
positions  of  the  platform  as  adopted 
until  after  their  ratification  by  each  of 
the  different  groups. 

V.  The  I.F.  is  in  solidarity  with  all 
feminist  struggles  of  today  and 
tomorrow.  The  feminist  revolution 
will  be  born  of  solidarity  in  the 
organized  feminist  struggle. 

No  feminism  without  the  libera- 
tion of  all  the  oppressed.  No  libera- 
tion of  the  oppressed  without 
feminism!

Elizabeth  Reid  attracted  attention 
as  a  feminist  spokeswoman  at  the 
International  Women's  Year 
Conference,  in  Mexico  City,  in  June, 
1975.  She  was  one  of  the  first 
declared  feminists  to  hold  a  high 
position  in  a  western  government, 
when  from  1973  to  December,  1975, 
she  was  the  advisor  on  women's  af- 
fairs to  the  Labor  Party  prime 
minister  of  Australia,  Gough 
Whitlam.  Since  the  defeat  of  the 
Labor  government,  she  has  studied 
and  spoken  on  the  issues  of  women, 
development,  and  feminism  on 
several  continents.  She  is  presently 
Director  of  the  United  Nations  Asian 
and  Pacific  Center  for  Women  and 
Development. 

The  following  is  a  condensed  ver- 
sion of  several  of  her  papers,  com- 
piled and  edited  by  Charlotte  Bunch. 

Introducing  the  Demands 

This  introduction  to  the  issues  of 
the  new  international  economic  order 
was  written  in  response  to  Quest's 
inquiry  about  why  this  demand  — 


and  the  U.N.  generally  —  are  impor- 
tant to  feminists  in  both  developed 
and  developing  countries. 

Access  to  food  and  to  income- 
providing  opportunities  for  women 
are  preconditions  to  any  long-term 
feminist  global  strategies.  In  the 
developed  countries,  the  female 
labour  force  participation  rate  is 
almost  50%,  whilst  in  the  developing 
countries,  it  is  estimated  at  about 
26%.  Globally,  during  the  next  few 
decades,  it  is  predicted  that  both  will 
decline. 

In  the  industrialised  countries, 
continued  or  recurrent  periods  of 
economic  stagnation  will  lead  to  high 
rates  of  unemployment  and  un- 
deremployment which  will  affect 
women's  ability  to  be  economically 
independent.  In  the  developing  coun- 
tries, changes  in  the  relative  impor- 
tance of  agriculture  will  lead  to 
women's  displacement  from  their 
traditional  sources  of  food  and  cash, 
without  necessarily  enabling  their 
participation  in  the  modern 
agricultural  sector.  Their  future  par- 
ticipation in  the  modern  sector  will  be 
determined  by  outside  interests,  such 
as  transnational  corporations,  other 
governments'  aid  programmes,  in- 
vestment patterns  and  the  types  of 


Women,  Economic  Development  &  the  U.N. /55 


technology  transferred  as  well  as  in- 
ternal bureaucratic  and  political 
decisions.  These  decisions  will  affect 
where  people  live  and  work,  what 
they  eat,  the  sorts  of  knowledge  to 
which  they  will  have  access,  and  the 
society  their  children  will  inherit. 


brought  their  demands  to  the  United 
Nations,  the  General  Assembly 
decided  to  declare  1975  International 
Women's  Year.  The  tradition  of  set- 
ting aside  such  years  is  quite  strong 
in  the  U.N.  Such  years  bring  together 
government    and    U.N.    officials, 


The  demand  —  coming  from  the 
developing  countries  —  for  a  new  and 
more  just  international  economic 
order  has  arisen  from  a  reluctance  to 
allow  such  outside  and  self-selected 
groups  to  be  the  architects  of  the 
future  of  developing  countries.  The 
forum  in  which  the  developing  coun- 
tries chose  to  present  their  demands 
was  the  United  Nations. 

In  the  early  '70s,  at  much  the  same 
time   that   the   developing   countries 


experts,  and  diplomats  to  devise 
plans  of  action  to  achieve  the  ends  of 
the  particular  year. 

The  thrust  to  use  the  U.N.  as  a 
forum  for  focussing  attention  on  the 
needs  of  women  has  not  been  as 
successful  in  mobilising  concern  for 
women's  needs  as  has  the  demand  for 
a  new  international  economic  order. 
Thus,  women  need  to  examine  the 
demand  for  a  new  international 
economic  order  from   two   perspec- 


56/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


tives  —  to  assess  its  impact  on 
women,  especially  in  terms  of  their 
economic  displacement  or  absorp- 
tion, and  to  compare  the  various 
successes  and  failures  of  this  demand 
and  of  the  demands  for  women,  in 
order  to  increase  our  skill  in  using  the 
international  arena  to  bring  about 
change. 

Why,  however,  should  feminists 
be  concerned  with  such  a  forum; 
what  do  we  hope  to  achieve  there? 
The  U.N.  functions  as  a  pressure 
group  on  its  member  governments.  It 
thus  allows  external  international 
pressure  on  a  particular  issue  as  a 
means  of  reinforcing  and  legitimizing 
demands  being  made  from  within  the 
country  as  well.  Furthermore,  after  a 
government  accedes  to  U.N.  conven- 
tions or  votes  in  favor  of  a  resolution 
—  the  U.N.  monitors  its  subsequent 
implementation,  providing  an  oppor- 
tunity  for  publicising  any 
backsliding  or  neglect  in  its  im- 
plementation. Thus  feminists 
working  within  or  without  in- 
stitutions such  as  the  civil  service, 
political  parties,  the  legislature  or 
trade  unions,  can  be  effectively 
assisted  by  such  international  in- 
itiatives. 

Any  changes  which  must  be 
brought  about  by  institutional  means 
(that  is,  non-self-help)  could  thus 
form  a  part  of  our  international 
demands.  Such  demands,  like  all 
such  demands  of  the  feminist 
movement1,  fall  into  two  basic 
categories:  those  which  lead  towards 
a  more  equitable  status  quo,  and 
those  which  lead  towards  more 
radical  structural  changes. 

Effectiveness  in  this  arena,  as  in 
many  other  institutions,  is  dependent 
on  our  skill  at  playing  power  games: 


know  our  own  facts,  know  how  the 
system  works  —  who  is  whose  con- 
fidante or  patron,  who  makes  the 
decisions,  the  network  of  contracts  — 
and  turn  the  system  to  the  advantage 
of  women.  This  particular  task  can- 
not be  done  from  outside  the  system. 

Critique  of  the  Demand 

This  section  is  edited  and  con- 
densed from  "A  Critique  and 
Analysis  of  the  Demand  for  a  New 
International  Economic  Order  vis-a- 
vis Women,"  a  paper  presented  to 
the  15th  Annual  Conference  of  the 
Society  for  International  Develop- 
ment, Amsterdam,  November- 
December  1976. 

Throughout  the  various  forums 
for  considering  the  demand  for  a  new 
international  economic  order,  a 
framework  has  emerged  for  sub- 
sequent discussions:  international 
trade;  transfer  of  resources  and 
monetary  reform;  science  and 
technology;  industrialisation;  food 
and  agriculture;  cooperation  among 
developing  nations,  and  restruc- 
turing the  United  Nations. 

Where  this  demand  has  been  ar- 
ticulated, it  has  curved  away  from  an 
increase  in  GNP  (Gross  National 
Product)  or  in  industrial  production, 
towards  the  satisfaction  of  basic 
needs  or  equal  access  to  oppor- 
tunities. The  justification  for  the  de- 
mand has  been  made  either  in  the 
name  of  international  justice,  or  in 
the  name  of  the  people  in  developing 
countries.  The  rhetoric  has  been  in 
terms  of  rights,  self-reliance  and 
dependence,  rejection  of  patchwork 
solutions,  and  ending  oppression. 

Coincidental  with  the  eruption  of 
the  demand  for  a  new  international 


Economic  Development/57 


economic  order  has  been  the  intru- 
sion of  women  into  the  same  inter- 
national arena.  The  justification  of 
these  two  demands  has  been 
remarkably  similar.  But  the  tactics 
and  strategies  of  the  women's 
demands  have  been  much  less  effec- 
tive. However,  the  goals  of  each 
necessarily  overlap,  and  any  solution 
or  short-term  compromise  will  have 
severe  repercussions  on  women. 

The  first  mention  of  the  relevance 
to  women  of  the  demand  for  a  new 
international  economic  order  was 
made  at  the  preparatory  meeting  for 
the  World  Conference  for  the  Inter- 
national Women's  Year,  in  February, 
1975.  It  was  a  straightforward 
political  move  and  evoked  an 
automatically  hostile  response  from 
those  who  had  been  adverse  to  the 
demand  itself  in  other  U.N.  sessions. 
One  side  insisted  that  the  demand 
had  absolutely  no  relevance  to 
women;  and  the  other  side  insisted 
that  it  had  every  relevance.  Neither 
side  had  any  understanding  of  the 
relevance  (or  otherwise)  of  the  de- 
mand to  women. 

A  few  women  realistic  enough  to 
understand  which  side  had  the 
numbers  attempted  to  forge  some 
tenuous  links  between  those  two 
demands.  Paragraph  eight  of  the 
IWY  Plan  of  Action  passed  in 
Mexico  City.  "As  a  result  of  the  un- 
even development  which  prevails  in 
the  international  economic  relations, 
three  quarters  of  humanity  is  faced 
with  urgent  and  pressing  social  and 
economic  problems.  The  women 
among  them  are  even  more  affected 
by  such  problems  and  the  new 
measures  taken  to  improve  their 
situation  as  well  as  their  role  in  the 
process  of  development  must  be  an 


integral  part  of  the  global  project  for 
the  establishment  of  a  new  economic 
order." 

It  is  clear,  however,  that  whilst 
there  was  an  intuitive  understanding 
of  the  basic  importance  of  the  linkage 
between  the  demands  of  women  and 
the  demand  for  a  new  international 
economic  order,  there  was  still  no 
clear  programmatic  articulation  of  it. 
This  failure  permeates  almost  all  of 
the  U.N.  documents  and  rhetoric  of 
the  Year,  and  now  of  the  Decade. 
This  failure  has  led  to  uncoordinated, 
ad  hoc  responses  to  the  call  for  action 
—  too  often  the  issuing  of  stickers  or 
postage  stamps  —  and  has  enabled 
such  responses  to  pass  for  concerned 
action. 

The  documents  at  best  list  the 
differing  manifestations  of  the 
problem,  and  as  these  differ  from 
society  to  culture  and  across  time,  the 
documents  are  a  hodgepodge  of  com- 
plaints, of  problems  identified  in  one 
area  treated  as  if  they  were 
ubiquitous,  and  of  localised  solutions 
similarly  generalised.  Moreover,  the 
various  deliberations  and  forums 
relating  to  women,  unlike  those 
relating  to  the  demand  for  a  new  in- 
ternational economic  order,  have  led 
neither  to  an  agreed-upon  set  of 
priorities  nor  to  a  proliferation  of 
further  forums  and  negotiations. 

The  goal  of  the  Decade  —  the  full 
integration  and  participation  of 
women  into  the  process  of  develop- 
ment —  can  only  be  achieved  when 
women  are  seen  as  an  integral  part  of 
all  development  planning  and 
projects,  including  the  demand  for 
the  restructuring  of  the  economic 
order.  The  responsibility  of  the 
Decade  is  to  devise  the  strategies  for 
successfully  translating  this  goal  into 


58/Quest 


action  —  a  formidable  task,  for  it  in- 
volves ensuring  that  women  take 
their  place  in  the  perceptions,  in  the 
world  views,  of  all  decision-makers. 
So  far,  no  mechanism  has  been 
devised  to  even  begin  this  task. 
Further,  it  involves  the  evolution  of 
an  adequate  theory  of  sexism,  one 
which  lays  bare  its  root  cause, 
provides  an  explanation  linking  the 
cause  to  its  varying  manifestations, 
supplying  criteria  for  selecting  the 
best  possible  solution  to  each 
manifestation. 

The  focussing  of  attention  on 
women  during  the  Year  was 
successful,  however,  to  the  extent 
that  the  midterm  appraisal  of 
progress  in  the  implementation  of  the 
International  Development  Strategy2 
singles  out  the  role  of  women  in 
development  as  a  priority  in  the  es- 
tablishment of  a  new  international 
economic  order.  But  the  imagery  of 
the  demand  for  a  new  economic  order 
is  still  often  taken  from  the  language 
of  those  blind  to  sexism:  e.g.,  dis- 
cussions of  poverty  which  speak  of 
"marginal  men."  One  cannot  help 
but  feel  that  such  language  truly 
mirrors  the  prevailing  perception  of 
reality,  of  a  world  where  many  men 
are  marginal,  but  where  the  women, 
if  perceived  at  all,  are  perceived  as 
marginal  to  the  marginal.  Like  fleas 
on  fleas. 

Goals  of  the  Demand 

The  ambitious  goal  set  for  the  first 
Development  Decade  (1960-70)  was 
a  5%  annual  increase  in  the  GNP  of 
developing  countries.  Surprisingly, 
their  average  growth  rate  over  the 
Decade  achieved  this  target.  But 
towards  the  end  of  the  Decade,  it 
became    clear    that,    despite    this 


phenomenal  growth,  unemployment 
was  rising,  absolute  poverty  was  on 
the  increase,  population  growth  con- 
tinued, and  income  distribution 
became  more  unequal.  Similarly, 
during  the  decade,  the  world's  gross 
international  product  increased  by 
approximately  $1  trillion,  of  which 
80%  went  to  the  industrialised  coun- 
tries (with  average  annual  incomes  of 
over  $1,000),  and  only  6%  went  to  the 
poor  nations  (with  average  annual  in- 
comes of  less  than  $200).  And  ad- 
ditionally, much  of  the  growth  in  in- 
ternational trade  took  place 
exclusively  among  the  more 
developed  countries. 

Thus,  whilst  the  U.N.  was 
struggling  to  formulate  the  Inter- 
national Development  Strategy  for 
the  Second  Development  Decade,  the 
developing  countries  were  beginning 
to  argue  that:  "The  peoples  of  Africa, 
Asia  and  Latin  America  have  largely 
paid  the  price  of  the  prosperity  and 
economic  power  of  the  wealthy  coun- 
tries. Consequently,  through  the 
monopolies  and  corporations  that 
belong  to  the  rich  countries,  through 
the  whole  process  of  exploitation  and 
processing  of  raw  materials  con- 
trolled by  them,  and  through  the  con- 
sumer markets  and  the  capital  that 
they  possess  almost  exclusively  and 
also  owing  to  the  fact  that  they  con- 
trol all  the  mechanisms  whereby  the 
prices  of  raw  materials  and  manufac- 
tured products  are  fixed,  the  in- 
dustrialized countries  transfer  the 
bulk  of  the  riches  of  the  Third  World 
into  their  own  pockets  ....  This  is 
equivalent  to  saying  that  the  present- 
ly existing  economic  order  looms  up 
as  the  most  serious  handicap  to  the 
development  and  progress  of  the 
Third  World  countries."3 


Economic  Development/59 


This  new  realization  crystalized 
into  the  demand  for  the  establish- 
ment of  a  new  international  economic 
order,  one  where  the  distribution  of 
benefits,  credit,  knowledge,  services 
and  decision-making  is  no  longer 
biased  in  favour  of  a  privileged 
minority.  In  short,  just  such  an  order 
as  women  have  been  demanding. 

The  goals  of  both  women  and 
developing  countries  have  included 
access  to  employment,  participation 
in  decision-making,  lessening  of 
poverty,  or  more  generally,  satisfac- 
tion of  basic  needs  and  equality  of 
opportunities. 

Both  these  latter  general  goals  are 
interventionist  in  that  they  imply  a 
rejection  of  the  claim  that  market 
forces,  if  given  free  play,  will  in 
themselves  lead  to  an  equalised  dis- 
tribution of  power,  wealth,  political 
influence,  corporate  control  or 
knowledge.  (This  holds  true  whether 
it  be  at  the  level  of  nations  or  of  in- 
dividuals, or  between  women  and 
men.)  And  they  are  reformist  in  that 
they  propose  a  set  of  changes  to  make 
the  present  order  more  equitable. 

The  "basic  needs"  approach  to 
development  is  certainly  the 
minimally  acceptable  one.  As  the 
U.N.  report  on  Employment,  Growth 
and  Basic  Needs  explains:  "The 
satisfaction  of  basic  needs  means 
meeting  the  minimum  requirements 
of  a  family  for  personal  consump- 
tion: it  implies  access  to  essential  ser- 
vices, such  as  safe  drinking-water, 
sanitation,  transport,  health  and 
education;  it  implies  that  each  person 
available  for  and  willing  to  work 
should  have  an  adequately 
remunerated  job.  It  should  further 
imply  the  satisfaction  of  needs  of  a 
more  qualitative  nature:   a  healthy, 


humane  and  satisfying  environment, 
and  popular  participation  in  the 
making  of  decisions  that  affect  the 
lives  and  livelihood  of  the  people  and 
individual  freedoms."4 

Each  of  these  basic  needs  is  an  in- 
dicator of  underdevelopment,  and  in 
most  societies,  the  responsibility  for 
their  provision  often  lies  with 
women.  Given  the  paucity  of  infor- 
mation about  them,  even  in  the  in- 
dustrial countries,  and  the  varying 
interpretations  to  which  each  need  is 
subject,  it  is  often  difficult  to  identify 
specific  needs,  the  affected  groups 
and  the  best  solutions.  Such 
problems  are  exacerbated  when  it  is 
the  basic  needs  of  women  which  are 
to  be  identified:  in  one  case  it  may  be 
nutrition,  in  another  freedom  from 
violence.  Basic  needs  may  differ 
between  countries  as  well  as  between 
cultures. 

The  successful  implementation  of 
the  "basic  needs"  approach  would 
require  the  political  will  of  each 
government  to  undertake  the 
required  policy  decisions  and  struc- 
tural changes  —  but  also  in  such  a 
way  as  to  pose  no  threat  to  its  con- 
tinuance. Moreover,  just  because  it  is 
a  minimal  strategy,  it  is  compatible 
with  almost  the  whole  spectrum  of 
alternative  development  strategies:  it 
commits  a  government  neither  to 
labour-intensive  nor  capital- 
intensive  industrialisation.  Nor  does 
it  force  further  distributionist  income 
or  wealth  policies,  or  determine  in- 
vestment policies.  However,  even 
minimal  redistribution  policies  need 
financing;  and  in  many  areas  (e.g. 
Latin  America),  there  would  not  be 
enough  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  all 
people  at  an  acceptable  level,  even  if 
wealth     were    evenly    distributed. 


60/Quest 


Thus,  the  success  of  the  "basic 
needs"  approach  is  directly  related  to 
the  success  of  the  demand  for  a  new 
economic  order  globally. 

As  for  the  second  general  goal,  the 
demand  for  equality  of  opportunity, 
one  interpretation  is  that  persons  or 
nations  have  equality  of  opportunity 
if  neither  faces  an  institutional 
obstacle  which  the  other  does  not. 
But  this  interpretation  is  clearly  insuf- 
ficient to  ensure  equality  of  outcome. 
In  this  sense,  both  raw  materials  and 
manufactured  goods  have  equal 
access  to  world  markets,  yet 
nevertheless  there  has  been  a 
systematic  difference  in  their  market 
value.  To  generalize  a  statement  of 
Mary  Daly:  asking  for  equality  in  the 
present  situation,  be  it  for  women  or 
developing  countries,  would  be  com- 
parable to  a  black  person  demanding 
equality  in  the  Ku  Klux  Klan.5 


The  demand  for  control  over  one's 
environment  (or  self-determination) 
is,  then,  basic  to  both  demands.  In 
relation  to  equality  of  opportunity 
for  nations,  it  is  assertively  stated  by 
Mahbub  ul  Maq:  "We  must  keep 
stressing,  as  often  as  we  can,  that  the 
basic  struggle  is  for  equality  of  op- 
portunity, not  equality  of  income. 
We  are  not  chasing  the  income  levels 
of  the  rich  nations.  We  do  not  wish  to 
imitate  their  lifestyles.  We  are  only 
suggesting  that  our  societies  must 
have  a  decent  chance  to  develop,  on 
an  equal  basis,  without  systematic 
discrimination  against  us,  according 
to  our  own  value  systems,  and  in  line 
with  our  own  cultural  traditions.  We 
are  not  asking  for  a  few  more  crumbs 
from  the  table  of  the  rich.  We  are 
asking  for  a  fair  chance  to  make  it  on 
our  own."6 

The  demand  for  structural  change 


Economic  Development/61 


has  been,  and  will,  of  course,  be 
strongly  resisted  by  those  who  have 
the  most  to  gain  from  the  status  quo. 
The  assumption  that  the  existing 
economic  system  is  sound  and  to  be 
preserved  at  all  costs  —  the  very 
assumption  which  many  of  the  con- 
crete proposals  and  demands  of  the 
developing  countries  have  challenged 
—  has  formed  the  basis  of  the  United 
States'  counter-proposals  for  a 
"moderate  international  order" 
throughout  the  negotiations.  This 
moderate  order  has  been  thought  of 
as  capable  of  emerging  from  the  pre- 
sent situation  without  having  to 
assume  violent  dislocation  or 
millenial  changes  in  human  nature. 

The  analogous  moderate  (or  refor- 
mist) response  to  the  women's 
demands  could  possibly  be:  "which 
of  the  proposals  of  the  World  Plan  of 
Action  can  we  accommodate  at 
minimal  or  no  cost  or  other  in- 
convenience, and  without  threat  to 
our  jobs  or  power  bases?"  Inter- 
estingly enough,  there  has  been 
no  felt  need  for  such  an  accommoda- 
tion. And  because  no  serious  atten- 
tion has  been  paid  to  these  demands, 
the  women  have  not  been  challenged 
to  produce  a  set  of  concrete  proposals 
towards  the  implementation  of  their 
demands.  Fuzz  prevails. 

Concrete  Proposals  of  the  Demand 

Two  of  the  most  important 
proposals  are  agricultural  reform  and 
the  determination  to  raise  the 
developing  countries'  share  of  world 
industrial  production  from  its  pre- 
sent level  of  7%,  to  25%  by  the  year 
2000.  The  ramifications  of  these 
proposals  for  women  are  immediate. 
The  great  bulk  of  the  female 
labour  force  in  the  developing  coun- 


tries is  still  in  agriculture  (e.g.,  over 
90%  and  80%  in  some  countries  in 
Africa  and  Asia,  respectively),  and 
they  produce  44%  of  all  food 
produced.  Moreover,  rural  women 
work  in  conditions  of  appalling 
drudgery,  with  primitive  tools  and 
little  or  no  exposure  to  modern 
methods  of  farming. 

Modernisation  of  the  agricultural 
sector  has  excluded  women  from  the 
new  employment  opportunities.  And 
predictably,  the  modern  industrial 
sector  tends  to  be  a  male  preserve 
where  women  are  concentrated  in  a 
limited  number  of  occupations  at 
relatively  low  levels  of  skill  and 
responsibility.  Sexism  thus  remains 
the  most  pervasive  determinant  of 
who  will  work  and  where  and  for 
what  remuneration.7 

This  discrimination  sometimes 
arises  from  deep-seated,  often  un- 
conscious, cultural  and  social  norms, 
and  sometimes  from  unproven  and 
unquestioned  assumptions  about 
women's  inclinations  and  capacities. 
Often,  culturally  inappropriate  and 
harmful  assumptions  are  transported 
to  developing  countries  along  with 
technology,  aid  and  experts.  Further- 
more, although  the  absolute  number 
of  girls  receiving  education  has 
recently  increased,  available  figures 
indicate  that  in  many  countries  girls 
complete  only  two  or  three  years  of 
schooling  —  not  enough  for  the  re- 
tention of  literacy  or  numeracy. 
Needless  to  say,  the  situation  is  worst 
in  rural  areas. 

Thus,  sexism  of  the  new  world 
prevents  women  from  access  to 
education,  which  prevents  their 
access  to  training  —  all  of  which 
restricts  their  ability  to  participate  in 
a  whole  range  of  activities.  Sexism 


62/Quest 


from  the  old  world  —  which 
manifests  itself  in  the  structuring  of 
jobs,  in  patterns  of  participation  in 
the  workforce,  and  even  in  machine 
and  other  technological  design  — 
compounds  and  amplifies  these 
harmful  attitudes. 

These  patterns  of  limitation,  dis- 
crimination and  inequity  could  be 
minimised  by  informed  and  respon- 
sive development  planning,  if  its 
genuine  aim  were  to  ensure  the  full 
integration  of  women  into  develop- 
ment. The  trouble  is  that,  to  those 
who  have  the  responsibility  for  plan- 
ning and  for  implementation,  women 
still  remain  invisible.  While  there  is  a 
need  for  change,  it  should  be  clear 
from  the  above  that  the  changes 
which  these  proposals  will  have  on 
the  lives  of  the  women  of  the 
developing  countries  can  cause 
nought  but  harm  unless  immediate 
and  sensitive  meaures  are  taken  on 
the  national  level  to  counteract  them. 

The  fact  that  emerged  most  clearly 
from  the  deliberations  of  International 
Women's  Year  is  that  women  have 
been  so  invisible  that  development 
planners  and  technical  assistance  of- 
ficers have  come  and  gone  without 
even  noticing  them.  And  this 
blindness  persists  to  this  day,  even 
though  in  many  cases  it  is  women 
whose  needs  are  most  in  need  of 
attention.  Women  continue  living  in 
the  cracks  and  crevices  of  each  socie- 

Enabling  Features  of  the  Demand 

Proposals  such  as  a  thorough 
redistribution  of  wealth,  a  share  of 
the  power  over  capital,  technology, 
and  the  movement  of  goods  and 
labour  will  not  be  conceded  willingly. 
It  was  the  utilisation  of  oil  as  a 
political  weapon  that  freed  the  im- 


agination of  the  developing  countries 
and  brought  home  to  them  the 
dependence  of  the  industrial  world 
on  their  natural  resources. 

The  disruption  of  the  in- 
dustrialised world  by  a  small  group 
of  developing  countries,  the  use  of  oil 
as  a  tactical  weapon  in  the  Middle 
East  and  the  growing  unity  between 
the  Arabs  and  the  Africans  was  the 
backdrop  to  the  introduction  of  the 
demand.  Its  continuing  effectiveness 
has  depended  on  two  factors:  the 
politically  strategic  use  of  the  new 
wealth  and  the  growing  unity  and 
solidarity  of  the  developing  coun- 
tries. 

Although  the  industrial  world  can 
be  inconvenienced  by  the  deprivation 
of  commodities  such  as  bauxite  and 
phosphate,  only  oil  has  such  a 
capacity  for  far-reaching  impact  on 
Western  economies.  More  important- 
ly, this  new-found  wealth  has  been 
astutely  converted  into  further 
sources  of  power,  ones  which  can 
themselves  help  force  the  creation  of 
a  new  international  economic  order. 

The  response  of  the  industrial 
countries  to  the  rise  in  oil  prices  was 
to  attempt  to  ensure  that  the  resulting 
monetary  bounty  was  recycled.  The 
oil-producing  countries  invested 
money  in  selected  heavy  industries 
such  as  armaments,  transport  and 
steel.  This  prompt  response  to  the 
Western  invitation  to  recycle  and 
reinvest  caused  an  aggressive 
counter-response  to  "contain  the 
threat  of  excessive  foreign  in- 
vestment." Suddenly  the  role  of 
foreign  investment  in  world  affairs 
was  a  topic  for  self-examination 
amongst  those  countries  with  the 
balance  of  wealth  and  power. 

The  bulk  of  the  billions  of  dollars 


Economic  Development/63 


in  surplus  OPEC  funds  were 
deposited  in  a  few  U.S.  banks  at 
relatively  short  terms,  creating  a  high 
degree  of  dependence  on  politically 
volatile  deposits.  The  U.S.  Senate 
Foreign  Relations  Subcommittee  on 
Multinational  Corporations  began  to 
fear  that  the  U.S.  banking  system  as  a 
whole,  and  ultimately  U.S.  foreign 
policy,  was  vulnerable  to  a  sudden 
decision  of  the  OPEC  countries  to 
shift  their  funds.  This  fear  was  con- 
firmed by  the  British  experience,  in 
which  at  one  stage  the  official  and 
privately-owned  funds  deposited  by 
foreigners  in  London  banks  was 
nearly  twice  the  national  reserve. 
Shifting  these  funds  caused  a 
precipitous  decline  in  the  value  of 
sterling,  which,  in  turn,  aggravated 
inflation. 

The  oil-producing  countries  have 
thus  had  the  political  and  economic 
astuteness  to  use  their  funds  to  force 
major  changes  in  the  international 
monetary  system.  They  have  also 
used  them  to  gain  further  leverage  in 


international  affairs.  In  January, 
1975,  OPEC  countries  pledged  $800 
million  in  development  aid.  Of  this, 
$200  million  has  been  given  directly 
to  45  most  seriously  affected  coun- 
tries in  the  form  of  long-term, 
interest-free  loans  for  balance  of 
payments  support,  and  $400  million 
has  been  pledged  to  the  International 
Fund  for  Agricultural  Development, 
on  the  condition  that  the  West  make 
up  the  balance  of  $600  million.  If  this 
bullying  succeeds,  the  OPEC  con- 
tribution will  give  the  thirteen 
members  of  the  group  the  same 
voting  power  as  the  West  on  the 
funds  board,  which  will  also  include 
representatives  of  the  non-oil 
developing  countries. 

The  developing  countries  have 
shown  a  capacity  to  maintain  a  un- 
ited front  in  presenting  and 
negotiating  demands,  and  a 
willingness  to  commit  their  own 
funds  to  back  up  their  proposals. 
This  cooperation,  and  the  emphasis 
on  the  need  for  special  measures  for 


64/Quest 


those  countries  most  seriously 
affected,  are  manifestations  of  the 
broader  concept  of  collective  self- 
reliance  which  has  been  embodied  in 
all  their  documents  since  the  sixth 
special  session  of  the  U.N.  General 
Assembly,  held  in  1974. 

The  developing  countries  are  now 
entering  negotiations  and  bargaining 
collectively,  with  the  omni-present 
threat  of  industrial,  social  and 
economic  upheaval.  This  historic 
evolution  is  highlighted  in  the 
following:  "In  the  last  analysis,  the 
real  bargaining  power  of  the  poor 
nations  is  political,  not  economic. 
The  Third  World  contains  the 
overwhelming  majority  of  mankind. 
It  increasingly  enjoys  a  decisive  con- 
trol over  the  U.N.  General  Assembly. 
Its  vast  population  can  be  dis- 
regarded at  present;  its  U.N. 
resolutions  can  be  ignored;  its 
demands  can  be  brushed  away  as 
mere  rhetoric.  This  is  nothing  un- 
usual in  the  initial  phases  of  a  trade 
union  movement.  But  if  the  new 
trade  union  of  the  poor  nations  holds 
together  —  and  its  unattended 
grievances  are  likely  to  keep  uniting 
it  —  it  is  only  a  matter  of  time  before 
the  management  is  forced  to  enter 
into  serious  negotiations  and  the 
public  posturing  on  both  sides  ceases 
as  they  send  their  chosen  represen- 
tatives into  the  back  rooms  to 
hammer  out  hard,  tough  com- 
promises."8 

It  is  in  this  area  that  the  greatest 
and  most  depressing  contrasts  can  be 
drawn  between  the  demand  for  a  new 
international  economic  order  and 
those  for  women.  Mostly  women 
haven't  bargained  for  our  demands. 
Second,  we  haven't  even  realized  that 
we  needed   to  bargain,   or  that  we 


needed  a  bargaining  weapon.  Finally, 
we  don't  have  any,  anyway. 

We  have  no  weapon,  no  bargain- 
ing power.  We  have  no  power  base 
and  are  not  seen  to  have  one.  Even 
though  we  are,  on  the  whole,  seen  as 
an  undifferentiated  mass,  we  do  not 
even  have  the  power  of  numbers. 
What  threat  do  we  have  which  is 
analogous  to,  say,  the  threat  to  strike 
or  to  nationalise?  Although  the 
women's  vote  is,  at  times,  wooed,  a 
threat  to  withdraw  it  would  not  be 
taken  seriously.  Nor  could  we  carry 
out  such  a  threat  successfully,  for  we 
are  as  different  one  from  another,  in 
particular  in  our  concerns  and 
priorities,  as  men.  Lysistrata  is  a  male 
erotic  fantasy.  The  reality  would  be 
rape.  And  the  only  other  commodity 
over  which  we  have  a  productive 
monopoly  is  successive  generations 
—  the  issue  of  our  bodies. 

The  only  possible  weapons  at  hand 
for  us  are  proven  ability  and  persua- 
sion. We  must  become  skilled  in 
negotiating,  lobbying  and  the 
preparation  of  resolutions, 
documents,  legislation  and  the  like. 
We  must  gain  an  extensive  un- 
derstanding of  the  workings  of  the 
system,  be  well  briefed,  well- 
acquainted  and  visible.  The  art  of 
persuasion  lies  in  ensuring  that  all 
claims  are  properly  documented, 
analyses  penetrating,  strategies  clear- 
ly and  tellingly  presented.  The 
method  of  presentation  must  take 
into  account  the  prevailing  blindness 
and  the  probability  of  an  initial 
response  of  either  fear  or  boredom. 
These  are  the  only  means  we  have  of 
gaining  respect  in  those  arenas,  inter- 
national or  national,  where  we  must 
work. 

The  remaining  relevant  strength  is 


Economic  Development/65 


the  commonality  of  women's  percep- 
tion.  This  commonality  has 
overridden  political  affiliations  and 
power-plays.  A  most  vivid  instance 
of  this  occurred  when  an  attempt  was 
made  by  the  politicos  to  delete  from 
the  IWY  World  Plan  of  Action  the 
sentence  —  "basic  similarities  unite 
women  to  fight  differences  whenever 
they  exist  in  the  legal,  economic, 
social,  political  and  cultural  status  of 
women  and  men."  The  women  pre- 
sent in  the  drafting  group,  whatever 
their  ideology,  status,  or  age,  un- 
animously and  vocally  objected  and 
the  unanimity  of  their  objection 
stunned  all.  It  also  exhilarated  the 
women,  who  clearly  perceived  it  as  a 
radical  affirmation  of  their  common 
cause,  of  their  commonality. 


is  some  visible,  normally  physical, 
sign  of  differentiation  between  the 
colonisers  and  the  colonised  which 
forms  the  basis  for  consequent  dis- 
crimination, exclusion  and  humilia- 
tion. Women's  exploitation  and  op- 
pression bears  this  imprint. 

But  the  differences  between  the 
classically  colonised  and  women  are, 
for  women,  the  ultimate  debilitation. 
The  classically  colonised  have  a  visi- 
ble, finite  and  ever-present  goal  —  the 
regaining  of  their  land.  What 
territory  is  it  that  has  been  usurped 
from  women?  How  many  of  us  un- 
derstand the  depths  of  women's 
demands  for  our  bodies,  the  closest 
(other  than  a  room  of  our  own)  we 
can  come  to  a  claim  to  territoriality. 
And  this  is  an  individual  rather  than 


The  Colonization  of  Women 

The  classical  marks  of  colonisation 
are  that  a  majority  group  is  peceived 
as  a  minority  group;  that  the 
colonised  have  no  voice  in  the 
decision-making;  that  they  form  a 
pool  of  cheap  labour;  and  that  there 


a  unifying  solution.  For  the  classical- 
ly colonised,  the  act  of  overthrowing 
the  oppressors  was  the  threshold  of 
self-pride  and  regaining  a  sense  of 
one's  own  value.  It  was  to  step  out  of 
the  backdrop  to  become  the  human 
presence.9  What  effect  will  it  have  on

women  that  the  oppressors  to  be 
overthrown  are  fathers,  husbands, 
sons,  brothers,  sisters'  husbands? 
The  classically  colonized  are  fighting 
for  their  own  traditions,  their  old  way 
of  life,  whereas  this  is  the  very  thing 
that  is  colonising  women.  Sexism  is 
not  only  the  colonising  agent,  but  it 
also  creates  the  very  possibility  of  our 
being  colonised  by  mute,  seemingly 
tacit,  consent;  sexism  creates  the  vic- 
tim mentality  by  which  we  see  our 
colonisation  as  a  "natural"  part  of 
our  daily  lives. 

Those  demanding  a  new  economic 
order  want  to  end  the  relations  of 
dominance  and  subordination,  to  end 
the  humiliation  and  degradation  of 
their  past  and  present  oppression. 
Yet  their  understanding  of  their  own 
oppression  has  given  them  little  in- 
sight into  their  own  roles  as  op- 
pressors, no  understanding  of  the 
agony  and  extent  of  women's  sub- 
jugation. In  the  words  of  the  Three 
Marias:  "I  wonder  whether  the 
guerrillera  who  battles  side  by  side 
with  her  brothers  ....  is  fighting  side 
by  side  with  her  real  brothers,  or 
whether  these  brothers  may  not  still 
bear  within  themselves  the  roots  of 
treason,  both  in  the  dialogue  of  the 
present  struggle  and  in  the  future 
City."10 

Towards  a  Theory  of 
Women  and  Development 

The  following  is  taken  from  an 
outline  for  future  work  written  in  the 
fall  of  1976,  and  never  before 
published. 

The  position  of  women  has  often 
been  considered  a  test  whereby  an 
age  or  a  civilisation  can  be  judged.  It 
is  clear  that  the  position  of  women  is 


one  of  the  crucial  tests  by  which  the 
success  or  failure  of  development 
plans  can  be  assessed.  However,  it  is 
a  test  which  is  extraordinarily  dif- 
ficult to  apply,  for  as  yet,  there  is  no 
consensus  as  to  how  that  success  or 
failure  can  best  be  measured. 

The  indicators  most  commonly 
resorted  to  are  level  of  education  and 
wage  employment,  but  these  are 
clearly  meaningless  for  developing 
countries.  When  the  majority  of  il- 
literates are  women,  and  the  majority 
of  women  are  illiterate,  statistics 
showing  the  level  of  education  at- 
tained will  merely  place  most  women 
in  an  undifferentiated  majority 
category.  Again,  when  70-80%  of  the 
population  of  the  developing  coun- 
tries is  rural,  and  when  the  majority 
of  the  agricultural  workers  are  sub- 
sistence farmers  and  women, 
statistics  on  the  number  of  women  in 
wage  employment  (which  are  the 
only  employment  statistics  most 
governments  keep)  throw  little  light 
on  the  position  of  the  majority  of 
women. 

The  lives  of  women  in  developing 
countries  and  regions  can  neither  be 
described  nor  contained  by  such  in- 
dicators. Indeed  the  phrases  "posi- 
tion of  women"  or  "status  of 
women"  —  phrases  repeatedly  used, 
particularly  in  the  rhetoric  and 
documents  of  International  Women's 
Year  —  are  themselves  questionable. 
"Position"  can  be  taken  to  refer  to  a 
person's  place  within  a  social  struc- 
ture and  "status,"  to  the  prestige  ac- 
corded to  holding  that  position.  But 
the  reality  is  that  the  majority  of 
women  have  no  place  in  such  a  social 
structure,  not  even  on  the  bottom 
rung.  They  drop  right  through  such 
filters,  particularly  in  societies  where 


Economic  Development/67 


women  traditionally  have  been 
secluded,  and  live  invisibly  in 
society's  cracks  and  crevices.  It  is 
only  the  rich,  educated  and  healthy 
who  fall  feet  first  onto  some  stratum 
or  other.  It  is  only  these  who  can  be 
moved  up  the  ladder  and  receive  their 
rewards.  The  reality  is  that  the  most 
pervasive  problem  facing  women  in 
developing  countries  is  not  their 
status  nor  equal  pay  nor  child  care 
facilities  —  it  is  malnutrition.  Food, 
water,  shelter,  fuel,  health,  clothing 
remain  the  basic  necessities  of  life. 
On  the  whole,  it  is  women  who  bear 
the  responsibility  for  ensuring  their 
provision,  the  responsibility  for  day- 
to-day  survival.  And  it  is  women 
who  make  do. 

This,  then,  sheds  some  light 
on  which  model  or  approach  to 
development  might  best  help  women. 
The  governments  of  most  developing 
countries  are  now  at  least  paying  lip- 
service  to  the  need  for  social  as  well 
as  economic  development.  But  even 
where  social  development  is  a 
genuine  concern,  there  remain  two 
approaches  to  development,  which 
may  be  termed  the  "reformist,"  and 
the  "radical."  The  first  accepts  the 
system  as  a  whole,  and  sets  out  to  in- 
troduce certain  changes  which  are 
perceived  as  important  —  viz.,  enhan- 
cing the  status  of  women.  But  this 
approach  can  only  succeed  where  the 
struture  of  a  society,  its  institutions, 
and  values,  do  not  have  an  inbuilt 
discrimination  against  women.  If  the 
society  is  so  structured  that  women 
will  inevitably  be  precipitated  out,  in- 
visible and  mute,  into  its  interstices, 
then  radical,  not  just  reformist, 
changes  must  be  made  in  its  very 
structure,  its  institutions  and  values. 

The  radical  approach  to  develop- 


ment recognises  that  the  most  basic 
hindrance  to  equitable  development 
is  the  attitudes,  prejudices  and  beliefs 
that  each  society  holds  about  women, 
our  needs,  aspirations  and  abilities. 
These  attitudes  are  held  as  much  by 
women  about  ourselves  as  by  men,  as 
much  by  nationals  as  by  foreigners. 
The  fact  that  women  as  a  group  are 
supposed  to  have  —  indeed  are  forced 
to  have,  in  many  subtle  and  not  so 
subtle  ways  —  a  different  kind  of  per- 
sonality, a  different  pattern  of 
behaviour  as  a  group,  has  con- 
sequences for  our  position  in  society. 
It  does  not  simply  create  differences 
between  women  and  men,  as  groups; 
it  also  created  inequalities.  Our 
"womanly  virtues"  are  not  those  vir- 
tues which  are  rewarded  by  society, 
for  it  is  to  the  aggresive,  the  power- 
ful, the  competitive  and  the  single- 
minded  that  society  deals  out  its 
rewards:  power,  status,  wealth.  Our 
"virtues,"  enforced  and  imposed 
differences,  may  well  be  hallowed, 
but  valued  they  clearly  are  not.  And 
we  are  so  deeply  affected  by  this  ram- 
pant sexism,  for  this  is  what  that 
word  means,  that  we  mutely  consent 
to  our  own  colonisation,  to  the 
debilitation  of  altruism,  to  the 
debasement  of  passivity,  to  the 
humiliation  of  self-effacement.  For  as 
long  as  these  attitudes  persist,  and 
they  exist  in  all  societies,  women  will 
remain  in  an  inferior  position  and 
any  reforms,  though  they  may 
alleviate,  will  not  change  them. 

These  attitudes,  therefore,  act  as 
constraints  on  the  development 
process.  If  change  is  to  be  effected 
with  the  least  possible  dislocation  of 
people  and  their  lives,  such  attitudes 
must  be  known  and  openly  dis- 
cussed.   The   greatest    imbalance   in 


68/Quest 


development  occurs  when  only 
selected  groups  within  a  society 
benefit  from  it.  If  any  group  is  left 


outside  of  the  development  process, 
be  it  the  urban  poor,  women,  older 
people  or  the  rural  sector,  then  the 


Economic  Development/69 


resultant  situation  could  well  be 
described  as  a  form  of  internalised 
colonialism,  even  slavery. 

Thus  an  understanding  of  the  per- 
vasiveness of  sexism  leads  to  the  con- 
clusion that  the  integration  of  women 
into  the  process  of  development  will 
only  succeed  when  and  if  women  are 
recognised  as  an  essential  component 
in  each  development  project.  To 
attempt  to  recify  these  imbalances  by 
teaching  women  traditional  home 
economics  of  one  sort  or  another, 
traditional  "women's"  subjects,  is  to 
widen  even  further  the  gap  between 
men  and  women.  If  women  are  not 
literate  or  are  trained  only  in  these 
fields,  then  they  cannot  participate  in 
the  development  process  in  the  same 
way  as  men,  whatever  their 
capacities. 

It  should  not  be  forgotten  that  the 
development  planners  and  field  of- 
ficers, both  men  and  women,  are 
themselves  imbued  with  these  very 
attitudes.  A  natural  resistance  to,  if 
not  fear  of,  change  will  lead  them  to 
opt  for  the  easier  and  less  unsettling 
choice  of  separate  development.  It 
should  also  be  remembered  that  to 
work  for  the  goal  of  truly  integrated 
development,  of  ensuring  that 
women  are  included  in  every  aspect 
of  development  is  an  enormous, 
depressing,  frustrating  and  tiring 
task:  the  perception  of  each  person 
who  comes  into  contact  with  any 
woman,  each  person  planning  for 
development,  has  been  distorted  by 
these  deep-seated  and  often  un- 
conscious attitudes  and  prejudices. 

This  approach,  then,  gives  rise  to 
its  own  two-pronged  methodology. 
First,  women  must  be  helped  to  iden- 
tify their  needs  and  to  devise  the 
means  to  attain  them.  They  should  be 


trained  in  whatever  skills  are 
necessary  for  attaining  these  ends.  In 
this  way,  self-confidence  and  self- 
reliance,  the  basic  preconditions  for 
freedom,  will  grow.  Second,  each 
person  who  comes  into  contact  with 
any  woman,  and  each  person,  at  any 
level  of  that  society  or  elsewhere 
(such  an  international  agencies  or 
corporations),  who  makes  decisions 
which  affect  any  women's  present  or 
future  life,  must  become  sensitive 
and  informed,  must  question  and 
reassess  each  of  those  attitudes  which 
have  put  and  kept  women  where  we 
are  today. 

An  impossible  task?  Maybe  .  .  . 
but  the  only  one  which  will  bring  any 
benefit  to  women.

a  conference  on  the 


Great  Goddess 
Re-Emerging 


March  31  to  April  2, 1978 
University  of  California;  Santa  Cruz 


Today  the  symbol  of  the  Great  Goddess  is  re-emerging  in  a  culture  which  has 
been  patriarchal  for  thousands  of  years.  The  Goddess  is  being  rediscovered  as  a 
symbol  of  holistic  understanding,  cooperative  process  and  natural  energy,  of  season 
and  cycle,  waxing  and  waning,  birth  and  death. 

Focusing  on  aspects  relevant  today,  this  conference  will  explore  the  Goddess 
through  art,  ritual,  myth,  theater  and  poetry,  through  history,  archaeology,  religion 
and  psychology.

Untitled— a  poem 


By  PAOLA  LUDOVICI 
Rome,  Italy 


Non  ci  si  andava  mai 
a  spasso  con  i  pensieri: 
erano  rade  amiche 
amanti  della  casa 

l'uscio  un  baratro 

un  giorno 

ci  ritrovammo  a  tendere 
i  fili  del  bucato 
provammo  a  fame 
le  nostre  prime  liane 

incaute  acrobate  dell'aria 
sui  fili  corteggiamo 
le  nostre  amiche  — 
gli  scomodi  pensieri 

qui  la  morte  e  a   portata 

tra  i  panni  stesi 

e  l'occhio  nemico  del  sole. 


1  mano: 


We  never  used  to  go 
for  a  walk  with  our  thoughts: 
they  were  few  girl-friends 
who  loved  to  be  home 

the  door  a  precipice 

one  day  at  the  window 

we  faced  each  others  tightening 

the  laundry  lines  — 

we  tried  to  make  them 

our  first  vine-ropes 

as  daring  air  acrobats 
on  thin  ropes  we1  court 
our  girl-friends  — 
the  uncomfortable  thoughts 

here  death  is  handy: 
among  the  drying  laundry 
under  the  enemy  eye  of  the  sun

Discussion  on  Liberation 

This  article  was  based  on  an 
editorial  group  discussion  of  what 
topics  to  include  in  Japanese  Women 
Speak  Out.  Quest  editors  have  con- 
densed and  occasionally  rearranged 
the  original  text. 

I.  Is  the  Removal  of  Sexism  the  Only 
Concern  of  the  Women's  Movement? 
When  a  national  gathering  of 
women's  liberation  groups  in  Japan 
was  held  in  1970,  the  concern  most 
commonly  shared  by  the  participants 
centered  around  questions  like, 
"What  is  the  Liberation  of  Women?" 
or  "What  is  Sexism?"  One  of  the 
editors   of  Japanese    Women   Speak 


Out  was  concerned  that  this  showed 
that  the  Women's  Movement  was 
more  or  less  urban  in  character,  and 
that  their  concerns  were  limited  only 
to  women's  issues,  nothing  more,  ig- 
noring much  broader  socio-political 
struggles. 

In  many  countries  of  the  Third 
World,  particularly  in  countries  like 
Vietnam,  she  argued,  national  causes 
and  the  fight  of  women  are  not  two 
different  things;  they  are  one  and  the 
same.  The  example  of  women  in 
Sanrizuka  and  Kita  Fuji  (peasant 
struggles  against  land  appropriation 
by  the  Japanese  government  and  the 
U.S.  military)  tells  us  much  about  the 
link  between  women's  struggles  and 
broader  issues.  In  prewar  days, 
women  in  rural  areas  used  to  suffer 
much  more  from  the  feudalistic, 
patriarchal,  discriminatory  practices 
than  women  in  urban  areas.  This  was 
certainly  true  in  Sanrizuka  and  Kita 
Fuji.  When  the  land  struggles  began 
there,  it  was  the  men  in  both  these 
places  who  stood  in  the  front,  the 
women  staying  behind,  mainly 
preparing  the  food  for  the  men.  But 
gradually  they  came  to  be  involved  in 
the  fight  to  the  point  where  they 
organized  themselves  into  a 
Women's  Action  Corps,  fighting  in 
the  front  lines. 

What  mattered  to  these  women 
was  not  simply  changing  female- 
male   relationships,   but   forcing   the 


74/Quesf,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


Japanese  Women  Speak  Out/75 


government  to  give  up  its  project  of 
expropriating  their  land.  Their  work 
in  the  struggle  led  them  to  a  realiza- 
tion, an  awakening  to  liberation  not 
only  as  women  but  as  people  capable 
of  taking  action,  not  only  against 
husbands  and  families  but  also 
against  governments  and  riot  police. 

In  our  discussion,  this  approach  to 
women's  liberation  was  presented  as 
a  criticism  of  the  women's  liberation 
movement. 

Briefly  summarized,  it  argued  that 
as  long  as  the  women's  liberation 
movement  directs  its  attention  only 
to  women  in  cities  and  to  female-male 
relationships,  it  will  not  be  able  to  ap- 
preciate all  the  other  struggles  of 
Japanese  women  outside  the  cities,  let 
alone  the  struggles  of  women  in  other 
Asian  countries. 

Many  of  us  felt  that  this  view  of 
how  women  become  liberated  was 
too  simple  and  too  optimistic.  We  are 
all  women  who  are  involved  in  some 
way  or  other  in  various  kinds  of 
citizens'  movements  and  seeking 
ways  to  relate  to  the  Third  World,  es- 
pecially to  other  Asian  countries 
threatened  by  Japanese  economic 
domination,  by  fighting  against  it. 
Past  experience  proves  to  us  that 
however  militant  and  heroic,  such 
struggles  do  not  necessarily  change 
women's  status  as  second-class 
citizens.  The  struggle  in  itself  does 
not  always  assure  the  liberation  of 
women  from  the  age-old  concept  that 
women's  domain  essentially  is  and 
should  be  in  the  home.  Unless  this 
concept  is  specifically  challenged  by 
women  in  particular  struggles,  it  will 
continue  to  dominate  the  people's 
state  of  mind  and  their  way  of  life 
even  after  the  struggle  is  won. 

It   was    further   noted    that   while 


rural  women  are  still  primarily  in 
community-based  situations,  urban 
women  suffer  painful  alienation 
which  makes  it  difficult  for  them  to 
get  together.  And,  generally 
speaking,  men  of  all  politics  have  a 
built-in  discrimination  against 
women  that  will  not  change  until 
women  raise  the  question  and  refuse 
to  be  their  tools. 

We  all  agreed  that  the  women's 
liberation  movement  should  not  con- 
fine itself  solely  to  the  problem  of 
female-male  relationships,  but 
should  always  have  a  broader  out- 
look on  socio-political  problems, 
relating  to  them  as  much  as  possible, 
while  challenging  the  conventional 
sexist  concepts  and  practices. 

Why  Do  Japanese  Women  Put  Up 
With  Oppression? 

Why  do  most  Japanese  women  put 
up  with  being  oppressed  and  dis- 
criminated against?  One  group 
evolved  the  following  line  of  argu- 
ment. The  root  cause  of  discrimina- 
tion against  women  lies  in  the  divi- 
sion of  labor  betwen  men  and 
women,  in  other  words  our  fixed, 
sex-based  roles.  This  further  takes 
the  form  of  sex-based  wage  dis- 
parities in  the  area  of  work  and  gives 
rise  to  all  sorts  of  discrimination  in 
terms  of  employment,  social  status, 
promotion,  retirement  age,  etc.  The 
feudalistic  ideology  underlies  and 
strengthens  all  these  forms  of  dis- 
crimination. The  feudalistic  ethic  of 
the  "three  follows"  (follow  your 
father  when  young,  follow  your  hus- 
band when  married)  and  the  sexist 
teaching  that  women  are  hard  to  han- 
dle, still  have  a  grip  on  the  minds  of 
many  people  today.  We  may  call  this 
argument  opinion  A. 


76/Quest 


Noting  the  development  of 
autonomous  women's  liberation 
movements  in  western  countries,  opi- 
nion A  proponents  point  to  a  big 
difference  in  the  attitude  towards  sex 
in  Japan  and  in  these  countries,  es- 
pecially the  United  States.  Women  in 
the  U.S.  started  their  own  movement, 
strongly  repelled  by  the  fact  that  they 
are  regarded  only  as  sex  objects,  and 
this  feeling  has  developed  into 
widespread  indignation  among  broad 
sectors  of  women  there. 

But  in  this  country,  social  attitudes 
toward  sex,  as  toward  other  subjects, 
are  moderate.  Women  are  generally 
divided  into  two  categories:  chore- 
doers  called  housewives  and 
prostitutes.  This  social  atmosphere 
more  often  than  not  muffles  strong 
indignation  that  might  spur  women 
into  action  as  they  do  not  feel  they 
are  sexually  humiliated.  Insofar  as 
women  have  clung  to  the  old  con- 
sciousness that  woman's  place  is  in 
the  family,  they  have  functioned  as  a 
social  force  upholding  the  postwar 
economic  structure  with  its  emphasis 
on  high  economic  growth.  A  vast 
number  of  women  quit  their  jobs 
upon  marriage  or  when  they  have 
had  their  first  child.  The  number  of 
independent  female  professionals 
and  women  who  support  themselves 
is  not  much  more  than  it  was  before 
the  war.  Keeping  women  at  the  bot- 
tom of  the  wage  structure  fits  in 
beautifully  with  the  interests  of 
capital.  Those  who  claim  that 
women's  social  status  has  improved 
are  deluding  themselves. 

Opinion  A  stresses  that  the  most 
important  task  for  us  is  to  change  the 
consciousness  of  women  themselves 
—  the  deeply  entrenched  idea  that 
women  belong  to  family  and  family 


alone  and  that  woman's  job  is  to 
bring  up  children.  In  other  words, 
first  we  must  destroy  the  feudalistic 
ideology  that  seems  to  have  been 
practically  inseparable  from  women's 
nature. 

A  second  view,  opinion  B,  looks  at 
the  matter  as  it  relates  to  the  im- 
peratives of  capital.  The  post-World 
War  II  reforms  liberated  women  from 
the  old  family  system,  gave  them 
equality  with  men  under  the  law,  and 
enabled  them  to  participate  in 
political  and  social  life,  and  to  es- 
tablish a  foothold  in  the  professions. 
This  liberation  was  not  the  result  of 
struggle  on  the  part  of  Japanese 
women  themselves,  however,  but 
was  handed  down  from  above  by 
U.S.  occupation  authorities.  While 
there  was  a  women's  suffrage  move- 
ment in  prewar  days,  its  leadership 
was  largely  coopted  by  the  military 
supported  organizations. 

The  fact  that  women  did  not 
struggle  for  their  liberation  after  the 
war  surely  has  affected  women's 
frame  of  mind  in  postwar  Japan. 

What  happened  with  the  end  of 
the  war  was  that  oppression  and  dis- 
crimination imposed  by  the  family 
system  receded  into  the  background 
to  be  replaced  by  a  generalized  form 
of  discrimination  pervading  every 
sector  of  society.  While  before, 
women  had  a  single  obvious  focus 
for  their  anger,  now  the  source  of 
their  oppression  is  so  ubiquitous  as  to 
be  almost  invisible.  The  mechanism 
of  women's  oppression  is  subtle  — 
women  are  permitted  an  illusion  of 
freedom  as  long  as  they  pledge  their 
loyalty  to  the  society  which  is,  all  the 
while,  effectively  undercutting  the 
growth  of  their  anger  into  social  un- 
rest.

For  those  who  say  that  the  sex- 
based  division  of  labor  and  the 
feudalistic  ideology  that  bolsters  it  up 
are  the  root  of  women's  oppression,  a 
look  at  the  history  of  female  labor 
since  the  war  should  be  enough  to 
show  that  these  so-called  fixed  roles 
actually  undergo  qualitative  changes 
in  the  new  economic  and  industrial 
structure  built  around  monopolies. 

On  the  level  of  ideology,  too,  there 
is  actually  a  great  deal  of  flexibility  in 
the  propaganda  of  sexism.  The 
government,  trying  to  promote  its 
line  for  female  labor,  is  putting 
forward  the  so-called  American  prac- 
tice whereby  women  are  supposed  to 
Work  practically  up  to  their  delivery, 
then  quit  their  jobs  and  take  care  of 
their  children  full  time,  returning  to 
their  jobs  when  their  children  are  big. 
What  could  be  more  modern  than  an 
American  woman? 

This  "two  life  cycles"  theory  is 
supposed  to  be  congenial  to  the 
natural  life  pattern  of  women,  but 
when  applied  in  a  society  like  ours 
with  its  seniority  wage  system  and 
enterprise-centered  employment 
structure,  it  only  works  to  the  disad- 
vantage of  women.  This  theory,  by 
eulogizing  "family  responsibilities," 
plays  on  notions  of  "femininity"  while 
at  the  same  time  paying  lip  service  to 
the  role  of  women  in  the  labor  force. 
In  fact,  it  aims  to  make  women  into  a 
safety  valve  for  the  economy  in  times 
of  recession  and  unemployment. 

Despite  the  different  approaches 
that  A  and  B  groups  have  to '  the 
problem,  they  agree  that  sexism 
basically  originates  in  the  fact  that 
the  female  sex  bears  children.  In 
societies  where  the  utmost  priority  is 
placed  on  material  production, 
everything  is  evaluated  by  the  logic 


of  productivity.  Thus,  the  situation 
where  women  whose  natural  func- 
tion is  procreation  are  alienated 
from  a  materially  productive  process. 
An  important  task  of  the  women's 
liberation  movement  from  now  on 
should  be  to  challenge  this  very  logic 
of  material  production  first.

Where  Are  We  Headed? 

A  Critical  Analysis  of  30  Years 

of  Woman's  Policy 

Kaji  Etsuko,  one  of  the  editors  of 
Japanese  Women  Speak  Out,  sent 
Quest  the  following  introduction  to 
our  condensed  version  of  this  article. 
The  author  has  been  involved  in  lef- 
tist and  women's  movements  for 
mpre  than  twenty  years.  In  1969  she 
publicly  criticized  one  of  the 
traditional  women's  movements 
within  Sohyo  (General  Council  of 
Trade  Unions  of  Japan)  for  its  neglect 
of  women's  issues,  and,  together 
with  other  women,  organized  a  new 
women's  movement,  Asian  Women's 
Congress  to  Fight  Discrimination  and 
Aggression.  Since  then,  the  Congress 
has  been  the  most  militant  women's 
group  actively  engaged  in  both 
women's  issues  (discrimination  in 
workshops,  protest  against  revision  of 
the  Abortion  Law,  etc.)  and  political 
issues  including  economic  aggression 
and  exploitation  in  Asia  by  Japanese 
capitalists. 

Recently  Iijima  Aiko  raised  a  very 
fundamental  question  for  the 
women's  movement:  how  should 
women  in  Japan  fight  the  ideology  of 
the  Emperor  System  (Tenno-ism),  a 
system  which  is  the  very  basis  of 
sexism    in    Japan.     The    Japanese

women's  movement  as  a  whole  is 
now  at  a  crossroads.  Will  it  go  right 
or  remain  in  the  leftist  framework? 
Several  groups  already  have  stated 
that  they  will  pursue  feminism 
within  the  framework  of  the  present 
social  system,  not  directly  opposing 
the  Emperor  System.  A  women's 
liberation  movement  aiming  at  the 
total  transformation  of  society  is 
urgently  needed  in  Japan  today,  and 
the  Congress  and  other  women's 
groups  are  being  severely  challenged 
by  this  need. 

Recovery  After  Defeat  and 
The  "Woman's  Policy" 

Women's  liberation  was,  along 
with  land  reform,  the  dissolution  of 
the  Zaibatsu,  and  the  enactment  of  a 
new  constitution,  the  starting  point 
of  the  "new  Japan"  at  the  end  of 
World  War  II.  But  what  exactly  did 
this  "new  Japan"  mean  for  women? 

The  Japanese  government's  first 
policy  toward  women  after  defeat 
was  related  to  its  "sex  policy"  for  the 
soldiers  and  officers  of  the  occupa- 
tion army  advancing  into  Japan.  On 
August  18,  1945,  immediately  after 
Japan's  unconditional  surrender  to 
the  Allies,  a  note  was  sent  by  the 
Home  Ministry  to  every  police  chief 
in  the  country  ordering  them  to 
provide  adequate  facilities  for  sexual 
entertainment.  When  the  occupation 
army's  first  group  arrived  at  Atsugi 
military  base,  the  RAA  (Recreation 
and  Amusemet  Association)  was,  es- 
tablished with  a  fund  of  $30  million 
and  many  women.  Public  prostitutes 
as  well  as  women  desperate  for  jobs 
were  stationed  at  entertainment 
facilities  to  "welcome"  the  U.S. 
soldiers. 


The  so-called  liberation  of  women 
after  the  war  included  several  legal 
procedures  such  as  the  SCAP  (the  oc- 
cupation administration)  directive  in 
October,  1945  on  "the  Liberation  of 
Japanese  women  through  suffrage," 
the  establishment  of  equality 
between  men  and  women  under  the 
new  constitution  as  well  as  the  civil 
law,  the  abolition  of  the  old  family 
system  (in  which  the  wife  had  the 
status  of  a  legally  incompetent  per- 
son), and  the  abolition  of  the  crime  of 
adultery.  Thus,  most  of  the  objec- 
tives of  the  Japanese  feminist  move- 
ment for  prewar  days  were  achieved 
in  a  single  stroke  by  the  new  ruler, 
the  occupation  army.  In  the  first 
general  election,  39  women  were 
elected  to  the  Diet  (the  Japanese 
parliament).  Between  1946  and  1947 
many  women  appeared  for  the  first 
time  in  places  like  Tokyo  University, 
as  heads  of  villages  and  towns,  in 
local  assemblies  and  government  of- 
fices. 

While  women's  legal  equality, 
political  participation  and  emergence 
in  public  life  was  taking  place,  the 
mass  discharge  of  women  workers 
was  also  occurring.  After  Japan 
accepted  unconditional  surrender, 
the  economy,  which  had  deteriorated 
greatly  during  the  long  war,  was 
paralysed. 

Though  both  men  and  women  lost 
their  jobs,  women  workers  were  also 
forced  to  quit  jobs  given  to  men 
returning  from  the  front.  War  had 
brought  women  to  work  and  now  the 
end  of  the  war  deprived  them  of  their 
jobs.  It  is  not  surprising  that  during 
this  period  increase  of  human  traffic 
and  prostitution  became  a  social 
problem. 

Naturally    the    return    of    large 


S0/Quest 


numbers  of  men  to  civilian  life  after 
the  war  resulted  in  an  explosive  pop- 
ulation increase.  In  July,  1948,  the 
Eugenic  Protection  Law  was  passed, 
legalizing  abortion  in  order  to  cope 
with  food  shortages  and  a  population 
increase  of  around  1.2  million  per 
year.  Although  the  abortion  law  con- 
tained from  the  start  various  aspects 
such  as  the  idea  that  female  sexuality 
should  be  repressed  and  notions  of 
eugenic  ideology  and  population  con- 
trol, the  discriminatory  and  op- 
pressive nature  of  the  law  did  not 
clearly  emerge  until  1973  when 
Japanese  women  rose  up  to  oppose  a 
revision  of  the  Eugenic  Protection 
Law  which  would  have  strengthened 
these  aspects  and  made  abortions 
more  difficult  for  women. 

Working  Women's  Movement 

Shortly  after  the  end  of  the  war, 
CIU  (Congress  of  Industrial  Unions), 
the  communist-oriented  labor  federa- 
tion, became  the  mainstream  of  the 
postwar  Japanese  labor  movement. 
Under  the  leadership  of  the  CIU, 
women  workers,  along  with  young 
workers,  fought  aggressively 
through  direct  action  in  many  labor 
struggles.  Through  these  struggles, 
women  workers  in  the  Tokyo 
Teachers'  Union  gained  equal  pay  for 
equal  work  (1948)  and  the  Japan 
Teachers'  Union  won  an  agreement 
on  protection  of  motherhood.  In 
other  words,  many  women  workers 
in  the  CIU  managed  to  gain  their 
rights  and  continued  to  work  in  the 
days  when  workers  throughout 
Japan  were  being  hit  by  mass  dis- 
charges. 

In  the  1950's,  Sohyo,  an  anti- 
communist  council  of  trade  unions, 
took  over  labor  leadership  from  the 


CIU.  Women  workers  organized  in 
Sohyo  and  set  their  main  objective 
"to  win  every  condition  which  will 
enable  us  to  continue  to  work:"  day 
care  centers,  assistant  teachers  to 
substitute  during  child  delivery  leave, 
etc. 

The  main  wage  system  in  Japanese 
enterprises  is  the  seniority-order 
system.  No  matter  how  many  years 
she  works,  a  woman  is  usually  kept 
within  a  certain  "woman's  wage." 
On  the  other  hand,  women  workers 
in  Sohyo,  mainly  public  workers, 
have  achieved  equal  pay  for  equal 
work  and  share  with  men  in  the 
seniority  wage  system. 

The  women  workers'  struggle  in 
Sohyo  has  aimed  at  "protecting"  and 
"gaining."  Though  these  causes  are 
understandable,  what  they  have 
protected  and  obtained  must  be 
exposed.  The  day  care  center  cam- 
paign aimed  at  securing  women's 
right  to  work  has  gradually  been 
coopted  by  capital  which  began  to 
mobilize  and  to  incorporate 
housewives  into  the  labor  force  as 
part  of  its  high  economic  growth 
scheme.  Today  there  are  many  cor- 
porations which  provide  married 
workers  with  nursery  facilities.  Most 
of  them,  however,  are  open  only  to 
part-time  employees.  In  short, 
regular  female  employees  are  en- 
couraged to  retire  when  they  have 
children  and  return  after  several 
years  to  work  as  low-wage  part-time 
workers.  Further,  better  working 
conditions  and  wage  raises  were  ob- 
tained for  women  workers  who  were 
in  the  upper  ranks  and  not  for  part- 
timers  or  temporary  workers.  And  in 
general,  it  can  be  said  that  Japan's 
post-war  prosperity  has  been  the 
result    of    the    exploitation    of 


Japanese  Women/81

Okinawans,  Koreans  and  Southeast 
Asian  people. 

Another  way  in  which  Sohyo  has 
failed  women's  needs  is  in  its 
Women's  Departments.  While 
women  were  treated  as  no  better  than 
minors  in  the  earlier  union  federa- 
tion, the  CIU,  their  fighting  spirit 
was  always  highly  appreciated  by  the 
union  leaders.  Some  women's 
departments  were  so  vigorous  in  serv- 
ing women  that  one  public  workers' 
union  issued  a  notice  that:  "youth 
and  women's  departments  are  not  to 
have  their  own  rules  and  regulations 
which  would  undermine  the  control 
and  harmony  of  the  union."  These 
measures  were  intended  to  oppress 
and  split  the  labor  movement,  but 
more  important,  they  resulted  in 
obstructing  the  development  of  an 
autonomous  women's  movement. 

In  the  process  of  Sohyo  being 
formed,  many  women's  sections  dis- 
solved entirely.  Eight  years  after  its 
formation,  a  "women's  department" 
was  set  up  in  Sohyo,  but  the  revived 
women's  department  is  a  far  cry  from 
those  early  women's  sections  with 
their  strong  fighting  spirit,  always 
considered  a  "burden"  by  the  male 
unionists. 

Sexism  in  Work  and  in  the  Family 

Discrimination  in  present  years 
should  be  seen  against  the 
background  of  a  political  and 
economic  situation  in  which  Japan 
moved  away  from  its  former  policy 
of  rapid  economic  growth  depending 
on  the  U.S.  economy  and  toward 
expansion  into  Asia,  moving  out 
from  Korea  to  every  corner  of  the 
region.  The  industrial  structure  also 
underwent  a  transformation  in  which 
changes  in  the  labor  process  and  in 


patterns  of  consumption  transformed 
women's  lives  as  well  as  the 
government's  policy  toward  women. 

Prior  to  this  time,  "woman 
policies"  tended  to  either  be  incor- 
porated into  general  policies  or  to  be 
of  a  "protective"  nature:  motherhood 
protection,  mother-child  health  care 
—  a  part  of  the  social  welfare  policy. 
But  now  the  "woman  policy"  has 
emerged  largely  within  the  context  of 
the  nation's  labor  policy  and  it 
extends  to  almost  every  phase  of 
women's  lives:  capital  needs 
women's  labor.  Thus  a  spate  of 
research  on  factors  affecting  the 
mobilization  of  women  for  the  labor 
force  has  appeared  in  recent  years 
correlating  factors  such  as  husband's 
income,  number  of  children,  wife's 
educational  level,  etc. 

The  government's  policy  toward 
women  —  viewing  them  as  a  source 
of  cheap  labor  —  serves  the  interests 
of  capital  which  possesss  in  this 
powerless  labor  force  a  control  valve 
which  can  be  turned  on  and  off  as  the 
flow  of  capital  demands.  For  exam- 
ple, the  glowing  words  with  which 
part-time  work  is  recommended  to 
women  spell  nothing  but  insecurity. 
Regardless  of  how  many  women 
become  "workers"  in  this  sense,  or 
how  firmly  the  shift  system  is  es- 
tablished, part-time  labor  will  lead 
only  to  the  reinforcement  of  dis- 
crimination against  women. 

Mobilization  of  women  in  the 
labor  force  is  always  carried  out 
hand-in-hand  with  a  policy  toward 
family  life.  When  women  were  not 
needed  as  workers,  the  slogan, 
"working  mothers  should  return  to 
the  home,"  was  current  in  society 
generally.  But  once  the  shortage  of  a 
young     labor     force     seriously 


Japanese  Women/83 


threatened  high  profits,  the  policy 
toward  family  life  shifted  away  from 
children's  welfare  and  youth 
programs  to  a  policy  to  secure 
women's  labor,  a  policy  emphasizing 
"harmony  between  domestic  respon- 
sibility and  job  responsibility."  The 
government  then  proposed  to  in- 
crease nursery  facilities,  to  set  up 
day-care  centers  for  school  children, 
to  promote  public  services  like  gar- 
bage collection,  work  leave  during 
child-care,  and  so  on. 

But  the  government  did  not  let 
down  on  its  promotion  of  the  idea  of 
a  "mother's  role."  Women's  employ- 
ment as  a  whole  did  not  include  the 
employment  of  women  with  babies. 
In  short,  the  government  aimed  to  es- 
tablish a  double  life  cycle  for  women 
centering  around  the  part-time  job; 
first,  she  is  to  work  as  a  young 
laborer,  then  concentrate  on  child- 
care,  and  then  to  return  to  an  in- 
secure reemployment  with  the  help 
of  day-care  centers. 

The  role  of  the  family  was  also 
seen  as  crucial,  as  in  this  1968  report 
entitled  "Desired  Image  of  Family 
Life  —  What  is  the  role  of  family 
life?"  In  the  report  four  roles  of  fami- 
ly life  were  pointed  out:  (1)  to  main- 
tain humanity  (In  a  society  where 
alienation  deepens  as  development 
progresses,  family  life  is  practically 
the  last,  precious  place  where 
humanity,  a  sense  of  identity  and 
some  kind  of  security  can  be  found.) 
(2)  to  form  the  human  character, 
(Home  is  almost  the  only  place  where 
infants  and  children  can  be  raised  to 
become  human  beings  who  can  live 
in  society.)  (3)  to  foster  daily  life, 
(Home  is  not  only  a  place  to  maintain 
the  family's  health  and  reproduce 
energy  for  the  next  day,  but  one  of 


the  few  places  where  rest,  in  the 
larger  meaning  of  the  word,  is 
possible.)  (4)  to  protect  life  (There  is 
no  better  solution  to  the  problem  of 
old  people  and  the  handicapped  than 
the  joint  energy  created  by  the  family 
relationship). 

Of  course  the  other  side  of  this 
exaggeration  of  the  roles  of  the  fami- 
ly life  is  ignoring  the  responsibility  of 
society  and  the  politicians:  the  family 
is  expected  to  make  up  for  bad  ad- 
ministration. It  is  clear  that  the  one 
expected  to  be  the  all-purpose 
counter-measure  to  juvenile 
delinquency,  baby  sitter,  nurse  for 
the  elderly  and  disabled,  as  well  as 
the  preparer  of  husband's  meals  is 
the  woman  in  the  home.  This  is  the 
situation  at  present.  The 
phenomenon  of  recent  years  of 
women  killing  their  children,  often 
newborn  babies,  can  be  explained  as 
a  rebellion  against  individual 
"motherhood"  with  its  burdens  on 
women  which  are  becoming  in- 
creasingly difficult  to  shoulder. 

Women's  Movement  in  the  70's 

The  present  wave  of  the  women's 
liberation  movement  emeiged  in  the 
early  70's  as  the  New  Left  struggles 
were  dying  out.  Several  factors 
promoted  its  advent  at  this  time.  First 
was  the  impact  of  the  New  Left 
struggle  with  its  radical  ideas  and 
direct  action  methods  so  different 
from  those  of  the  old  left.  Secondly, 
there  was  the  new  form  which  the 
New  Left  created,  emphasizing 
solidarity  among  independent  in- 
dividuals determined  to  fight,  rather 
than  the  old  style  in  which 
organizational  forms  grew  out  of  an 
understanding  of  democracy  as 
majority  pressure.  Thirdly,  the  new 


84/Quesf 


power  of  people  who  had  long 
been  ignored  or  regarded  as  backward 
and  weak  people  —  Okinawans, 
Korean  and  Chinese  residents  in 
Japan,  Vietnamese,  Black  people  in 
the  U.S.  —  the  struggles  of  these  peo- 
ple greatly  encouraged  women. 
Women  in  urban  areas,  furthermore, 
discovered  strong  determined  women 
in  farming  villages  like  Sanrizuka 
and  Kita  Fuji  who  were  carrying  on 
militant  long-term  resistance  to  state 
power. 

The  women's  liberation  movement 
emerged  from  among  women  who 
had  been  involved  in  both  the  old  and 
the  new  left.  But  both  groups  had  a 
common  understanding  of  sexism  in 
Japan  as  deeply  connected  with  this 
country's  aggression  in  Asia,  its 
chauvinism.  Behind  the  women's 
liberation  groups'  advocacy  of  sexual 
freedom  lay  an  understanding  that 
patriarchal  monogamy  which  denies 
sexuality  is  also  the  foundation  of 
Japanese  chauvinism.  Thus, 
members  of  both  groups  united  in  a 
campaign  to  stop  "Kisaeng  tourism" 
—  the  sexual  exploitation  of  Korean 
women  by  Japanese  businessmen,

fact  of  sexism  should  be  admitted,

sexual  discrimination  is  not  as  impor- 
tant as  racial  discrimination  or 
prejudice  against  minority  groups 
such  as  the  Buraka  (outcast)  people 
and,  anyway,  will  disappear  when 
the  whole  svstem  is  changed. 

The  new  trend  of  women's  libera- 
tion in  the  70's  also  comprehended 
that  the  root  of  sexism  was  based  on 
division  of  labor  by  sex.  In  a  society 
which  gives  highest  priority  to 
material  production,  women  who 
produce  life  through  natural  func- 
tions are  essentially  alienated  from 
the  place  of  labor,  and  forced  to  live 
through  the  medium  of  sex.  Women 
began  to  realize  that  sexism  and 
sexual  division  of  labor  is  more  fun- 
damental than  any  other  form  of  dis- 
crimination or  division  of  labor,  and 
that  as  long  as  two  kinds  of  produc- 
tion —  production  of  materials  and 
production  of  human  beings  —  are 
not  recognized  as  being  of  equal 
value,  there  can  be  no  equality 
between  men  and  women  in  the  true 
sense. 

Today,  the  government  explains 
that  women's  liberation  is  syn- 
onymous with  the  development  of 
women's  power,  and  equality  is  op- 
posed to  protection  of  motherhood. 
At  the  same  time,  equality  between 
the  sexes  is  limited  to  "equal  oppor- 
tunity" and  "better  conditions,"  thus 
the  sexual  division  of  labor,  the  root 
of  the  sexism,  is  to  be  untouched.  But 
we  cannot  shift  all  the  responsibility 
onto  the  government  or  established 
women's  groups.  After  all,  our  task 
lies  in  breaking  through  these  limits.

Commentary 

The  Cuban  family  code  was 
drafted  in  July  1974.  Following 
extensive  discussion  throughout  the 
country,  the  Code  was  adopted  March 
8,  1975.  The  Cubans  view  the  Code  as 
the  beginning  of  a  prolonged  attack 
on  both  sexist  attitudes  and  women's 
"second  shift",  i.e.  complete  respon- 
sibility for  domestic  labor  as  well  as 
work  outside  the  home.  The  Code  is 
historically  important  as  one  strategy 
for  ending  sexism  under  socialism.  It 
has  been  praised  by  many  outside 
Cuba  as  an  exemplary  piece  of 
socialist  legislation. 

As  feminists  who  operate  in  a 
different  historical  context  and  situa- 
tion, we  must  be  careful  to  evaluate 
the  Code  in  terms  of  our  own  needs 
and  principles.  The  Code  raises 
rather  than  resolves  one  of  the  most 
difficult  issues  for  feminist  theory: 
the  role  of  the  heterosexual  family 
and  its  place  in  a  liberated  society. 


The  Cuban  Code  explicitly  identifies 
the  heterosexual  family  as  the 
".elementary  cell"  of  society  and  as 
the  "center  for  relations  of  common 
existence  between  men  and  women 
and  between  them  and  their  children 
and  between  all  of  them  with  their 
relatives." 

The  Code  involves  the  state,  es- 
pecially the  judiciary,  in  the  regula- 
tion of  marriage,  divorce,  alimony 
and  child  custody  and  in- 
stitutionalizes a  preference  for 
"judicially  recognized"  marriages. 
The  family  will  be  supported  and 
strengthened  by  the  state  and  is 
recognized  as  the  social  unit  for  the 
satisfaction  of  "deep  rooted  human 
needs  in  the  social  field  and  in  the 
field  of  affection  for  the  individual". 
Within  the  family  the  absolute 
equality  of  the  partners  is  stressed  as 
is  their  equal  responsibility  for  the 
satisfaction  of  all  the  needs  of  the 
family.  Family  responsibilities  should 
not  hinder  either  partner  in  the  pur- 
suit of  her/his  skill  or  profession,  but 
neither  should  family  life  suffer  as  a 
result  of  these  pursuits. 

While  these  principles  are  impor- 
tant to  the  development  of  equal 
relations  between  men  and  women, 
many  important  questions  of  concern 
to  feminists  outside  Cuba  remain  un- 
resolved. The  state  supported  bias 
towards  heterosexuality  is  extremely 
troubling.  Can  patriarchy  be  com- 
pletely eliminated  without  an  attack 


A  Look  at  the  Cuban  Family  Code/87 


on  the  channeling  of  sexuality  in 
exclusively  heterosexual  directions? 
What  happens  to  persons  whose 
deeply  rooted  social  needs  can  only 
be  met  by  relations  with  someone  of 
the  same  sex?  Feminists  have  traced 
strong  connections  between  the  sup- 
pression and  control  of  sexuality  and 
the  existence  of  authoritarian  social 
patterns.  These  connections  need  to 
be  considered  as  we  conceptualize 
our  ideal  social  organization. 

We  must  also  evaluate  the  bias 
towards  the  family  as  the  center  of 
child  development  and  "domestic" 
labor  and  the  involvement  of  the 
state  in  legitimating  and  regulating 
relations  between  men  and  women, 
parents  and  children.  The  nuclear 
family  structure  may  result  in  certain 
forms  of  psychological  development, 
forms  which  may  preclude  full 
development  of  individual  capacities 
and  true  sociability  —  or  it  may  be  es- 
sential to  such  development.  Without 
experimentation  with  a  wide  range  of 
forms  this  central  question  can  never 
be  resolved.  Furthermore,  we  must 
consider  what  types  of  socially 
necessary  labor  now  performed  in  the 
family  (cooking,  childcare,  etc.) 
should  remain  there. 

While  we  need  means  of  insuring 
responsibility  between  adults  and 
between  adults  and  children,  it  is  not 
clear  that  granting  the  state  a 
monopoly  on  regulating  and 
legitimating  these  relations  is  the 
solution.  Perhaps  the  feminist  ideal 
will  look  more  like  the  combination 
of  responsibility  and  fluidity 
suggested  by  Marge  Piercy  in 
Woman  on  the  Edge  of  Time. 

These  issues,  while  central  to 
feminism,  are  far  from  settled.  We 
should   learn  from  the  examples  of 


others,  but  the  hard  work  still  lies 
before  us:  to  develop  a  feminist 
theory  and  practice  adequate  to  our 
own  historical  situation,  needs  and 
visions.  The  Cuban  family  code  is  an 
important  document  for  feminists  to 
study,  but  it  should  be  analyzed  with 
these  questions  and  concerns  in 
mind.  The  following  are  excerpts 
highlighting  the  major  features  of  the 
code. 

The  Cuban  Family  Code 

WHEREAS:  The  equality  of  citizens 
resulting  from  the  elimination  of 
private  property  over  the  means  of 
production  and  the  extinction  of 
classes  and  all  forms  of  exploitation 
of  human  beings  by  others  is  a  basic 
principle  of  the  socialistic  society 
being  constructed  by  our  people,  a 
principle  which  must  be  explicitly 
and  fully  reflected  in  the  provisions 
of  our  legislation. 

WHEREAS:  Obsolete  judicial  norms 
from  the  bourgeois  past  which  are 
contrary  to  equality  and  dis- 
criminatory with  regard  to  women 
and  children  born  out  of  wedlock  still 
exist  in  our  country,  these  norms 
must  be  replaced  by  others  fully  in 
keeping  with  the  principles  of  equali- 
ty and  the  realities  of  our  socialist 
society,  which  is  constantly  and 
dynamically  advancing. 

WHEREAS:  The  socialist  concept  of 
the  family  is  based  on  the  fundamen- 
tal consideration  that  it  constitutes  an 
entity  in  which  social  and  personal 
interests  are  present  and  closely 
linked  in  view  of  the  fact  that  it  is  the 
elementary  cell  of  society  and,  as 
such,  contributes  to  its  development 


88/Qwesf,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


and  plays  an  important  role  in  the 
upbringing  of  the  new  generations. 
Moreover,  as  the  center  for  relations 
of  common  existence  between  men 
and  women  and  between  them  and 
their  children  and  between  all  of 
them  with  their  relatives,  it  meets 
deep-rooted  human  needs  in  the 
social  field  and  in  the  field  of  affec- 
tion for  the  individual  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  1  -  This  Code  regulates 
judicially  the  institutions  of  the  fami- 
ly —  marriage,  divorce,  parent-child 
relations,  obligations  to  provide 
alimony,  adoption  and  tutelage  — 
with  the  main  objectives  of  con- 
tributing to:  —  the  strengthening  of 
the  family  and  of  the  ties  of  affection 


and  reciprocal  respect  between  its 
members;  —  the  strengthening  of 
legally  formalized  or  judicially 
recognized  marriage,  based  on  ab- 
solute equality  of  rights  between  men 
and  women;  —  the  most  effective 
fulfillment  by  parents  of  their  obliga- 
tion regarding  the  protection,  moral 
upbringing  and  education  of  their 
children  so  they  can  develop  fully  in 
every  field  as  worthy  citizens  of  a 
socialist  society;  —  the  absolute 
fulfillment  of  the  principle  of  equali- 
ty of  all  children  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  2.  -  Marriage  is  the 
voluntarily  established  union 
between  a  man  and  a  woman  who  are 


Cuban  Family  Code/  89 


legally  fit  to  do  so,  in  order  to  live 
together. 

Marriage  will  have  a  legal  effect 
only  when  it  is  formalized  or 
recognized  in  keeping  with  the  rules 
established  in  this  Code  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  24.  -  Marriage  is  es- 
tablished with  equal  rights  and  duties 
for  both  partners. 

ARTICLE  25.  -  Partners  must  live 
together,  be  loyal,  considerate, 
respectful  and  mutually  helpful  to 
each  other  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  26.  -  Both  partners  must 
care  for  the  family  they  have  created 
and  each  must  cooperate  with  the 
other  in  the  education,  upbringing 
and  guidance  of  the  children  accord- 
ing to  the  principles  of  socialist 
morality.  They  must  participate,  to 
the  extent  of  their  capacity  or 
possibilities,  in  the  running  of  the 
home,  and  cooperate  so  that  it  will 
develop  in  the  best  possible  way. 

ARTICLE  27.  —  The  partners  must 
help  meet  the  needs  of  the  family 
they  have  created  with  their 
marriage,  each  according  to  his  or  her 
ability  and  financial  status.  However, 
if  one  of  them  only  contributes  by 
working  at  home  and  caring  for  the 
children,  the  other  partner  must  con- 
tribute to  this  support  alone,  without 
prejudice  to  his  duty  of  cooperating 
in  the  above-mentioned  work  and 
care. 

ARTICLE  28.  -  Both  partners  have 
the  right  to  practice  their  profession 
or  skill  and  they  have  the  duty  of 
helping  each  other  and  cooperating  in 
order  to  make  this  possible  and  to 
study  or  improve  their  knowledge. 
However,  they  must  always  see  to  it 


that  home  life  is  organized  in  such  a 
way  that  these  activities  are  coor- 
dinated with  their  fulfillment  of  the 
obligations  posed  by  this  Code  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  29.  —  The  economic  basis 
of  matrimony  will  be  joint  property 
of  goods  as  contemplated  in  this 
Code  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  49.  —  Divorce  will  result 
in  the  dissolution  of  the  matrimonial 
ties  and  all  the  other  effects  men- 
tioned in  this  section. 

ARTICLE  50.  —  Divorce  can  only  be 
obtained  by  means  of  a  judicial 
decree. 

ARTICLE  51.  -  Divorce  will  take 
effect  by  common  agreement  or  when 
the  court  determines  that  there  are 
factors  which  have  led  the  marriage 
to  lose  its  meaning  for  the  partners 
and  for  the  children  and,  thus,  for 
society  as  a  whole. 

ARTICLE  52.  —  For  the  purposes  of 
this  law  it  is  understood  that 
marriage  loses  its  meaning  for  the 
partners  and  for  the  children  and, 
thus,  for  society  as  a  whole  when 
there  are  causes  which  create  an 
objective  situation  in  which  the 
marriage  is  no  longer,  or  cannot  be  in 
the  future,  the  union  of  a  man  and  a 
woman  in  a  manner  adequate  to  exer- 
cise the  rights,  fulfill  the  obligation 
and  obtain  the  objectives  mentioned 
in  Articles  24-28  inclusive. 

ARTICLE  53.  -  Either  one  of  the 
partners  can  take  action  to  obtain  a 
divorce  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  58.  -  If  the  partners  have 
lived  together  for  more  than  a  year  or 
if  children  have  been  born  during 
their  marriage,  the  court,  when  hand-

ing  down  the  decree  of  divorce,  will 
grant  an  alimony  for  one  of  them  in 
the  following  cases: 

1)  the  partner  who  does  not  have  a 
paying  job  and  lacks  other  means  of 
support.  This  will  be  temporary  and 
it  will  be  paid  by  the  other  partner  for 
six  months  if  there  are  no  minor 
children  in  his  or  her  care  and  guar- 
dianship, or  for  a  year  if  there  are,  so 
the  beneficiary  can  obtain  a  paying 
job; 

2)  the  partner  who  because  of  age, 
disability,  illness  or  other  insur- 
mountable obstacle  is  unable  to  work 
and  lacks  other  means  of  support.  In 
this  case  the  alimony  will  continue  as 
long  as  the  obstacle  exists. 

ARTICLE  57.  -  In  the  decree  of  a 
divorce  the  court  will  grant  patria 
potestas,  establishing  as  a  rule  that 
both  parents  shall  retain  it  over  their 
minors. 

However,  the  court  may  grant  it  to 
the  parent  whom  it  feels  should  have 
it,  when  this  is  required  by  the  in- 
terests of  the  minors,  outlining  the 
reasons  why  one  or  the  other  is 
deprived  of  it. 

Likewise,  the  court  may  determine, 
outlining  its  basis  for  doing  so,  the 
negation  of  patria  potestas  to  both 
parents  when  necessary  for  the  in- 
terests of  the  children,  in  which  case 
the  children  will  be  placed  under 
tutelage. 

ARTICLE  58.  -  In  the  decree  of 
divorce  the  court  must  determine 
which  of  the  parents  will  have  guar- 
dianship and  care  over  the  children 
born  during  the  marriage  and  will 
take  the  necessary  measures  so  the 
children  can  maintain  adequate  com- 
munication with   the  parent  that  is 


not  entrusted  with  their  guardianship 
and  care  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  59.  —  Support  of  minors  is 
a  duty  of  both  parents  even  if  they  do 
not  have  patria  potestas  over  them  or 
even  if  the  children  are  not  under 
their  guardianship  and  care  if  they 
are  enrolled  in  an  educational  institu- 
tion .  .  . 

ARTICLE  60.  -  The  amount  of 
alimony  for  minors  will  be  deter- 
mined by  their  normal  expenses  and 
the  income  of  the  parents,  in  order  to 
determine  the  responsibility  of  the 
latter  in  a  proportionate  manner  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  84.  -  The  children  are 
obliged  to  respect,  show  considera- 
tion for  and  help  their  parents  and  to 
obey  them  while  under  their  patria 
potestas. 

ARTICLE  85.  -  Patria  potestas  en- 
tails the  following  rights  and  duties 
of  the  parents: 

1)  keeping  the  children  under  their 
guardianship  and  care;  making  every 
possible  effort  to  provide  them  with  a 
stable  home  and  adequate  nourish- 
ment; caring  for  their  health  and  per- 
sonal hygiene;  providing  them  with 
the  means  of  recreation  fitting  their 
age  which  are  within  their 
possibilities;  giving  them  the  proper 
protection;  seeing  to  their  good 
behavior  and  cooperating  with  the 
authorities  in  order  to  overcome  any 
situation  or  environmental  factor  that 
may  have  an  unfavorable  effect  on 
their  training  and  development; 

2)  seeing  to  the  education  of  their 
children;  inculcating  them  with  love 
for  learning;  seeing  to  it  that  they  at- 
tend school,  seeing  to  their  adequate 
technical,  scientific  and  cultural  im-

titude and  vocation  and  the  demands 
posed  by  the  country's  development; 
and  collaborating  with  the 
educational  authorities  in  school 
programs  and  activities; 

3)  training  their  children  to  be  useful 
citizens;  inculcating  them  with  the 
love  for  their  country,  respect  for  the 
country's  symbols  and  their  coun- 
try's values,  the  spirit  of  inter- 
nationalism, the  standards  of 
coexistence,  and  socialist  morality, 
respect  for  social  property  and  the 
property  and  personal  rights  of 
others;  arousing  the  respect  of  their 
children  by  their  attitude  toward 
them,  and  teaching  them  to  respect 
the  authorities,  their  teachers,  and 
every  other  person; 

4)  administering  and  caring  for  their 
children's  property,  seeing  to  it  that 
their  children  use  and  enjoy  in  a 
proper  manner  whatever  property 
they  have;  and  not  to  sell,  exchange, 
or  give  any  such  property  except  in 
the  interest  of  the  children  pursuant 
to  the  requisites  of  this  Code; 

5)  representing  their  children  in 
every  judicial  action  or  arrangement 
in  which  they  are  involved;  giving 
their  authorization  in  those  cases 
where  full  capacity  for  taking  action 
is  required;  and  taking  action  oppor- 
tunely and  in  due  fashion  to  defend 
the  children's  interest  and  property. 

ARTICLE  86.  —  The  parents  are  in- 
vested with  the  authority  to  repri- 
mand and  set  straight  adequately  and 
moderately  those  children  under  their 
patria  potestas  .  .  . 


ARTICLE  89.-..  .Under  equal  con- 
ditions, the  court  will  generally 
decide  that  the  children  be  left  under 
the  care  of  the  parent  in  whose  com- 
pany they  have  been  until  the  dis- 
agreement arose.  Preference  is  given 
to  the  mother  in  the  case  that  the 
children  lived  with  both  father  and 
mother,  unless  special  reasons  make 
another  solution  advisable  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  93  —  Both  parents  or  one 
of  them  will  lose  patria  potestas  over 
their  children  when: 
1)  unappealable   judgment   is    im- 
posed on  them  for  criminal  action  .  .  . 

ARTICLE  95  —  In  keeping  with  the 
circumstances,  the  court  may  deprive 
one  or  both  of  the  parents  of  patria 
potestas  or  suspend  their  exercise  of 
patria  potestas  ...  by  a  judgment  dic- 
tated on  a  motion  made  by  one  of  the 
parents  or  by  the  distict  attorney,  in 
the  case  where  one  or  both  parents: 

1)  are  grossly  derelict  in  their  duties 
as  established  in  Article  85; 

2)  induce  the  child  to  carry  out  a

3)  abandon  the  national  territory 
and,  therefore,  their  children; 

4)  observe  a  defective,  corrupting, 
criminal  or  dangerous  conduct  in- 
compatible with  the  exercise  of  patria 
potestas; 

5)  commit  a  crime  against  the  child.

"Leibian/feminist  writers  are  undertaking  the  hard  work  of 
creating  a  tradition  of  our  own.  one  which  could  not  have 
been  created  before  our  time.  I  tee  CONDITIONS  as  one  of 
the  placet  where  this  work  is  being  done  with  seriousness  and 
intelligence.  Certainly  the  poetry  in  the  fust  issue  would  be 
reason  enough  for  subscribing.  And  to  subscribe  means  to 
help  give  continuity  to  our  culture:  to  nourish  that  which 
nourishes  us."

Feminist  &  Women's 
Resources  &  Publications 


Compiled  by  DOROTHY  ALLISON 

Feminist  &  Women's  Resources  and 
Publications  Outside  the  U.S. 


The  feminist  community  extends 
throughout  the  world,  from  battered 
women's  shelters  in  London,  to  study 
groups  in  Berlin,  to  women  workers 
and  students  who  publish  a 
newsletter  in  Madras,  India.  Five 
years  ago  the  magazines,  newsletters 
and  broadsides  published  within  this 
community  would  have  made  a  small 
but  impressive  list.  The  problem, 
then  and  now,  is  to  locate  the  women 
and  organizations  involved. 

When  we  began  work  on  this  issue 
of  Quest,  we  went  first  to  several 
sources:  mailing  lists  from  inter- 
national women's  conferences;  the 
back  pages  of  other  feminist  pub- 
lications for  ads  and  announcements; 
the  lists  of  publications  printed  in 
other  journals;  and  our  own  files.  In 
the  course  of  a  year  and  a  half,  we 
have  encountered  many  of  the 
problems  women  communicating 
over  great  distances  have  always 
faced.  Many  groups  had  disbanded. 
Women,  as  well  as  organizations  and 
publications,  changed  their  names  or 
their  addresses.  What  was  once  a  16 
page  glossy  monthly  became  an 
irregular  4  page  newsletter.  The 
postal  services  proved  uncooperative 
and  uncertain,  sometimes  losing 
letters,  often  raising  rates  and  oc- 
casionally   going    out    of    business 


themselves.  Some  replies  to  our 
original  letters  were  still  coming  in  a 
full  year  after  the  mailing. 

For  these  and  other  reasons,  what 
follows  is  by  no  means  a  complete 
list.  With  few  exceptions  we  are  not 
including  magazines  published  in  the 
U.S.  We  are  including  only  those 
publications  which  are  still  being  dis- 
tributed and  for  which  we  can 
provide  an  address.  We  are  not  in- 
cluding those  we  were  told  about  but 
could  not  reach  for  verification, 
except  for  publications  recently 
verified  by  ISIS,  the  Women's  Inter- 
national Information  and  Com- 
munication Service.  Wherever  possi- 
ble we  have  also  quoted  the  prices  in 
both  the  currency  of  the  country  of 
origin  and  in  U.S.  dollars.  Unless 
otherwise  noted,  all  publications  are 
in  the  offical  language  of  their  coun- 
try. In  many  cases  we  were  unable  to 
get  complete  data,  and  for  those  we 
recommend  that  you  write  the 
magazines  for  further  information.

Organizers'  Dialogue 


graphics  by  Constance  Samaras 

Editors'  Introduction: 

In  this  issue  we  have  chosen  to 
discuss  international  conferences  in 
the  Organizers'  Dialogue.  In  the  past 
few  years,  there  have  been  an  in- 
creasing number  of  international  or 
multi-regional  conferences  for  or 
about  women.  While  access  to  such 
events  is  obviously  limited,  they  are 
nevertheless  one  of  the  few  occasions 
beyond  an  individuals  travel  —  for 
exchange  among  feminists  from 
different  countries.  As  we  seek  to  ex- 
pand feminist  ideas  and  experiences 
beyond  national  boundaries,  it  is  im- 
portant to  analyze  the  possibilities 
and  problems  of  such  events. 

The  most  widely  publicized  inter- 
national women's  event  in  recent 
years  was  the  U.N. -sponsored  IWY 


Conference  and  Tribunal  held  in 
Mexico  City  in  1975.  Several  of  the 
articles  in  this  issue  of  Quest  refer  to 
that  conference,  which  has  also  been 
discussed  widely  in  many  places.  In 
this  section,  we  are  presenting  views 
on  two  other  important  women's 
conferences  both  held  in  1976  —  The 
Wellesley  Conference  on  Women 
and  Development  and  The  Inter- 
national Tribunal  on  Crimes  Against 
Women  held  in  Brussels.  Unlike 
IWY,  neither  of  these  conferences 
was  sponsored  by  governments.  The 
following  two  articles  discuss  the 
value  of  international  gatherings  and 
suggest  some  of  the  ways  that  the 
structure  and  organization  of  a 
conference  affect  it  as  much  as  the 
content. 


A  Critical  Look  at  the 
Wellesley  Conference 

By  NAWAL  EL  SADAWI, 

FATIMA  MERNISSI, 

and  MALLICA  VAJARATHON 

In  June  1976  a  Conference  on 
Women  and  Development  was  held 
in  Massachusetts  at  Wellesley 
College.  Its  purpose  was  to  facilitate 
an  exchange  of  data  and  ideas  among 
international  scholars.  The 
conference  was  attended  by  women 
from  over  30  countries.  Many  par- 
ticipants from  Third  World  countries 
were  critical  of  the  content  and  struc- 
ture of  the  conference.  The  following 


article  outlines  some  of  these 
criticisms  and  suggests  alternative 
approaches  to  the  organization  of 
future  international  events.  The 
authors,  Nawal  El  Sadawi,  Fatima 
Mernissi  and  Mallica  Vajarathon,  are 
respectively  from  Egypt,  Morocco 
and  Thailand,  and  have  all  been  in- 
volved in  women's  studies  in  their 
own  societies  as  well  as  international- 

Other  variations  of  this  article 
have  been  published  in  ISIS  Inter- 
national Bulletin,  (No.  3,  April,  1977) 
and  in  WIN  News,  (Vol.  Ill  No.  3, 
1977).  The  article  was  brought  to  our 
attention  by  ISIS  and  we  are  reprint- 
ing'Selections  because  we  feel  that  it 


Resources  &  Publications/  101 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


is  an  important  critique,  which 
provides  constructive  ideas  on  how 
to  approach  international  dialogue 
and  events. 

Papers  drawn  from  the  pro- 
ceedings of  the  Wellesley  conference 
and  other  perspectives  on  it  have 
been  published  in  the  Autumn,  1977 
issue  of  SIGNS,  Journal  of  Women 
in  Culture  and  Society  (V.  3,  H  1). 

The  Wellesley  Conference  on 
Women  and  Development  was  an 
historical  event  in  women's  efforts  to 
transcend  national,  ideological  and 
political  boundaries,  representing  an 
attempt  to  escape  the  male-imposed 
divisions  and  create  a  powerful  inter- 
national movement.  This  conference 
can  be  called  "successful"  precisely 
because  it  was  a  painful  clash 
between  well-meaning  American 
women  academicians  who  believed 
themselves  to  be  ahead  of  American 
men,  freed  from  colonial  and 
imperialist  limitations  on  one  hand, 
and  on  the  other  hand,  overly  op- 
timistic Third  World  women  who 
had  believed  that  the  impossible 
dialogue    between    people    of 


developed/developing  nations  could 
be  restored  by  women,  between 
women,  and  for  women. 

One  interpretation  of  the  results  of 
the  Wellesley  Conference  is  that  it 
was  premised  on  an  assessment 
which,  when  closely  analysed,  was 
not  one  of  united  power  but  one  of 
naivete,  and  therefore  unrealistic. 
The  notion  of  united  power  is  based 
on  the  false  belief  that  the  mere  fact 
of  being  women  is  a  binding  enough 
characteristic  to  create  instantaneous 
international  sisterhood  above  and 
beyond  political  differences  and 
unequal  power  distribution.  The 
basic  assumption  in  this  naivete  is 
that  women  are  not  political  beings. 
This  assumption  has  generated  an 
apparent  "sisterhood"  which  could 
only,  sooner  or  later,  explode  with 
even  more  damaging  and 
demoralizing  results  unless  we  face 
now  the  contradictions  among 
women  across  the  world  realistically. 

The  conference  could  have  been 
one  step  ahead  of  the  UN  sponsored 
International  Women's  Year 
Conference    where    Third    World 


102/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  2,  winter,  1978 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


discontent  was  felt  and  voiced  but 
not  analyzed.  Wellesley  might  have 
offered  an  occasion  to  do  this,  but  did 
not,  unfortunately,  get  to  it.  We  feel 
that  what  was  wrong  with  the 
conference  was  that  it  was  meant  to 
be  an  international  gathering,  when 
in  fact  it  was  an  American-planned 
and  organized  conference,  misleading 
Third  World  participants  who 
sought  fruitful  encounters  with 
researchers  of  different  nationalities. 
They  were  reduced  to  being  passive, 
accomodating  audiences  rather  than 
participants. 

The  clash  between  women  from 
developing  countries  and  the 
conference  organizers  occurred  at 
three  levels.  The  first  level  of  conflict 
related  to  content,  or  the  choice  of 
issues  given  priority  by  the 
conference  organizers;  the  second 
level  centered  around  the  organiza- 
tion and  structure  of  the  conference; 
and  the  third  level  was  that  of  per- 
sonal interaction,  or  the  lack  of  it. 

Conflict  Over  Content 

It  is  very  revealing  that  the  IWY 
Conference  in  Mexico  in  1975  was 
split  into  two  separate  groups  which 
happened  to  fall  along  the  lines  of 
developed  and  developing.  The 
women  from  industrially  developed 
countries  focussed  their  attention  on 
the  oppressive  conditions  of  women 
in  developing  countries;  the  causes  of 
oppression  became  secondary.  For 
example,  discussion  about  the  effects 
of    so-called    "development"    and 


"modernization"  on  the  degrading 
economic  conditions  of  women  in 
developing  countries  was  not  linked 
to  economic/political  factors  such  as 
the  role  of  the  multi-national  cor- 
poration. When  Third  World  women 
tried  to  attract  attention  to  the  role  of 
the  multinationals,  they  were  accused 
of  being  nonfeminist;  of  imitating 
the  male  in  his  political  games;  and 
"splitting  the  spirit  of  sisterhood  in 
the  Women's  Movement." 

The  Mexico  IWY  Conference 
pattern  was  reproduced  at  the 
Wellesley  Conference,  although  it 
assumed  its  own  peculiar 
characteristics.  One  of  the  painful 
surprises  to  Third  World  participants 
was  the  absence  of  papers  on 
American  women,  be  they  black, 
white  or  brown.  One  of  the  topics  on 
which  the  Third  World  women 
expected  information  was  how  the 
development  process,  geared  to  the 
priorities  of  the  multinational  cor- 
porations, affected  American  women 
of  different  classes  and  races,  and  the 
mechanisms  which  make  American 
women  powerless  in  the  system.  This 
absence  made  us  realize  that  we  were 
invited  to  attend  a  conference  where 
mostly  American  "scholars"  were 
interpreting  for  us  our  condition,  our 
cultures,  our  religions  and  our 
experiences.  The  absence  of  papers 
on  American  women  restored  for  us 
the  hardly-healed  colonial  experience 
wherein  the  detached  outsiders 
define  vour  world  to  you. 

The  absence  of  analysis  of  the 
American  women's  situation,  as  this 


Organizers'  Dialogue/103 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


relates  to  development,  led  to  another 
shortcoming  of  the  conference:  the 
lack  of  a  re-questioning  of  the 
narrow  classical  concept  of  develop- 
ment, often  equated  with  material 
and  technological  growth,  divorced 
from  human  growth.  This  issue, 
which  should  have  been  the  main 
focus  of  a  conference  labeling  itself, 
"Women  and  Development,"  became 
a  marginal  issue  dealt  with  in  sub- 
sidiary discussions. 

Furthermore,  the  lack  in  the 
Wellesley  Conference  panels  of 
indepth  analysis  of  economics  and 
money  as  it  relates  to  international 
trade  and  multinational  corporations, 
and  of  such  critically  important  fac- 


how  they  affect  the  lives  of  women  in 
and  outside  of  the  U.S.,  could  have 
been  a  valuable  contribution  of 
American  women  to  the  international 
conference,  because  that  kind  of  data

Critique  of  Organization  and 
Structure 

The  power  issue,  which  was  the 
main  cause  of  the  clash  between 
Third  World  participants  and  or- 
ganizers, became  clear  at  the  or- 
ganizational level.  A  glance  at  the  of- 


tors  as  health  within  countries,  also 
illustrates  a  poor  designation  of 
topics.  Moreover,  no  panel  was 
devoted  to  the  important  question  of 
credit  and  women's  access  to  money 
and  banking,  which  is  a  key  to 
power. 

Information  on  the  latest  decisions 
of  multinational  corporations'  ac- 
tivities in  and  outside  of  the  U.S.,  and 


ficial  programme  of  the  conference 
reveals  that  in  spite  of  the  fact  that 
the  conference  was  called  "Women 
and  Development,"  the  number  of 
women  from  developing  countries 
involved  at  the  levels  of  organizing, 
panel  convening  and  papergiving 
was  ridiculously  small.  Third  World 
contribution  was  minor,  especially  if 
you  take  into  account  that  most  in-

Organizers'  Dialogue 


dividuals  involved  on  substantive 
levels  were  either  Westerners  based 
in  or  outside  of  the  U.S.,  or  women 
from  developing  countries  based  in 
the  U.S.,  often  for  many  years. 


discussions,  the  women  from 
developing  countries  could  have  had 
more  opportunity  to  contribute.  At 
the  very  least,  increased  discussion 
time  would  have  given  Third  World 


It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the 
regions  of  the  world  where  change  in 
women's  condition  has  been  a  priori- 
ty for  their  governments  over  the  last 
decades,  i.e.,  the  socialist  countries, 
were  hardly  represented  at  all. 

The  numerical  underrep- 
resentation  of  women  from 
developing  countries  in  the  panels 
could  have  been  partially  compen- 
sated for  by  a  better  time  structure. 
There  was  hardly  any  time  for 
discussion.  In  most  cases,  the 
panelists  took  up  all  the  time  and  the 
discussion  period  often  was 
shortened  to  a  ridiculous  span. 
Moreover,  many  panelists  tried  to 
make  up  for  the  length  of  their 
papers  by  speeding  up  their  diction, 
making  it,  for  us,  an  heroic  attempt 
to  understand  the  English  at  all.  In 
spite  of  the  language  problem,  if  there 
had  been  equal  time  for  papers  and 


participants  the  opportunity  to 
correct  inaccurate  information 
presented  about  their  own  cultures. 

The  insistent  requests  by  Third 
World  women  for  more  discussion 
time,  and  their  impatience  with 
lengthy  reading  of  papers  —  full  of 
incorrect  information  and  inter- 
pretations of  their  cultures  —  were 
perceived  by  the  organizers  as 
disruptive  behaviour.  A  series  of 
meetings  was  held  by  a  Third  World 
contingent  to  persuade  the  organizers 
to  change  the  conference  structure. 
After  repeated  clashes,  it  became 
clear  that  the  organizers  expected  us 
to  sit  quietly  and  listen  respectfully  to 
the  papers,  no  matter  what  their  con- 
tent. 

When  Third  World  women 
realized  that  the  organizers  were  not 
willing  to  make  any  changes  in  the 
programme,  they  decided,  as  a  last 


Organizers'  Dialogue/ 105 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


resort,  to  forego  any  attempt  to  par- 
ticipate in  decision-making  as  far  as 
the  actual  conference  was  concerned. 
They  chose  instead  to  concentrate  on 
the  writing  and  publishing  of  the 
conference  proceedings.  They  spent 
hours  in  nightly  meetings  attempting 
to  restructure  the  editorial  committee, 
and  thereby  have  some  influence  on 
the  proceedings.  To  their  dismay, 
they  found  that  the  organizers  who 
were  heavily  represented  on  the 
editing  board  were  unwilling  to  give 
in  on  that  issue  either. 

Personal  Interaction 

The  organizers  did  not  understand 
why  the  Third  World  women  were 
uncomfortable  with  their  power- 
lessness  to  participate  in  the  de- 
sign of  the  panels,  or  to  contribute 
in  any  meaningful  way  to  the  rigidly 
structured  conference.  They  acted 
just  like  the  men  who  organize 
meetings  involving  women's  issues, 
without  getting  the  women  involved 
in  the  planning  and  policy  decision- 
making. For  them,  power  was  not  the 
issue  because  they  had  it. 

According  to  the  perceptions  of 
the  organizers,  blame  for  the  clash 
which  took  place  lay  with  the  Third 
World  women  who  failed  to  "adjust" 
to  the  "well-organized"  conference. 
The  American  organizers  had  no  ad- 
justment to  make  and  considered 
themselves  unjustly  attacked  by  un- 
grateful Third  World  elements. 
Moreover,  the  response  of  the  or- 
ganizers   to   dissident  Third   World 


participants  was  to  criticize  them  on  a 
personal  level.  By  so  doing,  they  gave 
the  impression  that  what  was  prevent- 
ing international  dialogue  between 
women  was  a  matter  of  individuals 
and  personality  defects,  rather  than 
political  differences  and  questions  of 
global  structures,  values,  choices  and 
priorities. 

It  is  a  common  syndrome  in  the 
context  of  colonial  "dialogue"  for  the 
oppressor  to  blame  protest  and  dis- 
sent on  the  presumed  character 
defects,  hang-ups  and  short-comings 
of  the  colonized.  This  syndrome, 
which  was  prevalent  at  Wellesley, 
needs  to  be  seriously  scrutinized  by 
American  women  genuinely 
interested  in  breaking  down  the  male 
colonial  pattern. 

Recommendations 

The  fact  that  until  now  these  inter- 
national gatherings  have  failed  to  be 
really  international  in  the  full  sense 
of  the  word  does  not  mean  that  the 
potential  is  not  there.  On  the  con- 
trary, the  fascinating  thing  is  that, 
throughout  the  world,  women  feel 
the  strong  and  urgent  need  to  create 
international  solidarity,  and  this  need 
could  materialize  if  some  changes  are 
brought  about  in  the  structure  and 
nature  of  these  women's  encounters. 
There  are  at  least  two  alternatives  for 
such  events:  encounters  organized 
internationally  and  encounters  or- 
ganized locally. 

Taking  the  latter  first,  national 
conferences,  locally  organized,  where 


106  /Quest 


Organizers9  Dialogue 


participants  from  outside  would  have 
status  of  full-fledged  participants  or 
observers,  could  serve  two  purposes. 
They  could  provide  U.S.  scholars 
with  the  chance  to  feel  helpless  and 
awkward  in  a  foreign  setting  they 
don't  control,  which  would  give  them 
new  insights  into  inter-dependency 
relations.  Such  conferences  would 
also  give  more  women  access  to  inter- 
national gatherings  and  more  visibili- 
ty to  local  activists  and  scholars. 

For  a  conference  to  be  genuinely 
international,  women  from 
developing  and  developed  countries 
have  to  be  involved  on  an  equal  basis 
in  the  organizing  of  the  conference 
from  its  very  beginning,  starting  with 


stumbling  block  in  the  choice  of 
researchers  from  developing  coun- 
tries. Much  insightful  research  and 
studies  have  been  done  by  people  in 
developing  countries,  often  in  their 
native  languages,  without  being 
published.  Publishing  is  still  one  of 
the  most  safeguarded  monopolies  of 
developed  countries.  Ironically 
enough,  those  who  publish  are  not 
necessarily  those  who  are  the  more 
creative  and  innovative  in  their  think- 
ing, but  those  who  have  access  to 
Western-based  publishing  networks. 
If  a  woman  has  done  creative  work, 
no  matter  in  what  language,  that 
should  be  the  primary  criterion  en- 
titling her  to  participate  in  meetings. 


fundraising,  topic  choice,  designation 
of  panel  participants,  panel  con- 
vening, etc. 

1  his  leads  us  to  the  question:  who 
should  be  invited  to  such 
conferences?  The  American  academic 
system  has  serious  hang-ups  about 
publication.  It  is  up  to  Amejicans  to 
deal  with  this  idiosyncracy. 
However,    it   should   not  become   a 


A  broader-based  participation  will 
necessitate  the  use  of  translation 
facilities  which  will  help  transcend 
the  language  obstacle.  Funding  of 
such  facilities  should  be  considered  a 
priority.  Breaking  down  the  language 
barrier  will  maximize  the  con- 
tributions of  all  the  participants,  par- 
ticularly of  those  who  do  not  speak 
Western  languages.  This  will  help  to 


Organizers'  Dialogue/107 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


create    real    internationalization    of 
knowledge  about  women's  issues. 

Another  important  element  which 
made  the  so-called  international 
conference  so  rigid  was  the 
exaggerated  importance  accorded  to 
publication  of  the  proceedings.  To 
invest  so  much  money  and  effort  in 
bringing  together  knowledgeable 
people  ought  to  have  broader 
applications  beyond  an  academic 
reading  of  papers  to  each  other. 
Interpersonal  communication  be- 
tween the  participants  ought  to  be 
considered  an  important  component. 
Free    time    and    flexible    scheduling 


should    be    characteristic    of    these 
meetings. 

We  felt  the  duty  to  write  about  our 
experiences  at  the  Wellesley 
conference  for  many  reasons,  but 
particularly  because  we  believe  that 
encounters  between  people  from 
different  cultures  and  geo-political 
areas  can  be  very  fruitful  and  highly 
inspiring.  We  therefore  think  that  im- 
provement of  the  methodology  of 
truly  international  conferences  is 
possible,  it  people  make  the  effort  to 
understand  each  other,  and  take 
upon  themselves  the  arduous  task  of 
critical  self-analysis. 


A  Commentary  on  the 
International  Tribunal 


By  DIANA  RUSSELL 

It  is  over  a  year  since  more  than 
two  thousand  women  from  forty 
countries  came  to  Brussels,  Belgium 
in  March  1976  to  participate  in  the 
First  International  Tribunal  on 
Crimes  Against  Women.  The 
Tribunal  constituted  the  first  attempt 
by  feminists  to  address  crimes  against 
women  on  an  international  scale. 
Focusing  on  the  crimes  as  personally 
experienced  by  women  rather  than 
engaging  in  abstract  debates  seemed 
to  the  organizers  particularly  ap- 
propriate as  a  first  step  in  moving  our 
struggle  into  an  international  context. 
It  was  our  belief  that  women's 
recognition  of  our  common  interests 


in  combating  the  crimes  to  which  we 
are  subjected  should  help  us  to  more 
easily  transcend  differences  in 
nationality,  culture,  class,  race, 
sexual  preference,  age,  and  politics. 
Was  this  strategy  successful?  What 
did  the  first  International  Tribunal 
achieve? 

In  her  opening  message  to  the 
Tribunal,  Simone  de  Beauvoir 
declared  that  women  who  had 
gathered  together  in  their  separate 
countries  to  fight  their  oppression 
would  "for  the  first  time  .  .  .  become 
conscious  of  the  scandal  of  their  con- 
dition." And  we  did.  Just  as  we  have 
learned  that  women  have  to  break  out 
of  our  isolation  within  our  com- 
munities in  order  to  see  the  political 
nature  of  our  oppression,  so  do  we 
have  to  break  out  of  our  isolation 
within  national  boundaries.  And  just 
as  we  have  learned  that  sisterhood  is 


108/Quest 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


powerful,  so  the  Tribunal  helped  us 
to  see  that  international  sisterhood  is 
more  powerful.  I  see  breaking 
through  nationalism  as  a  major  ac- 
complishment of  the  Tribunal.  We  in 
the  U.S.  need  to  pay  particular  heed 
to  this  idea.  Americans  are  often 
rather  parochial  and  chauvinistic.  It 
is  not  uncommon  for  feminists  in  the 
U.S.  to  think  that  they  have  more  to 
teach  women's  movements  elsewhere 
than  to  learn  from  them.  How  many 
of  us  know  anything  about  the  situa- 
tion of  women  and  the  state  of  the 
women's  liberation  movements  in 
Canada  or  Mexico,  let  alone  the  rest 


of  the  world?  We,  and  women 
everywhere,  need  to  develop  a  greater 
sense  of  solidarity  towards  women  in 
other  countries  —  to  see  our  sisters' 
oppression  everywhere  as  an  exten- 
sion of  our  own  oppression.  Only 
then  can  the  strength  to  be  gained 
from  international  sisterhood  begin 
to  be  realized.  The  struggle  is  an  in- 
ternational struggle  and  the  Tribunal 
was  an  important  step  towards 
recognizing  and  actualizing  this. 

One  of  the  crucial  lessons  of  the 
Tribunal  was  to  show  us  that, 
regardless  of  enormous  differences  in 
culture  and  economy,  our  situation  as 


Organizers'  Dialogue/ 109 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


women  is  remarkably  similar.  Take 
the  treatment  of  rape  victims,  for 
example.  Testimony  from  France, 
Denmark,  Portugal,  Holland, 
Norway,  Japan  and  the  United  States 
reveals  that  it  is  always  the  victim 
who  is  put  on  trial.  The  situation  of 
battered  wives  was  also  almost  iden- 
tical in  different  countries:  women 
have  nowhere  to  escape  to,  and 
receive  little  sympathy,  help  or  un- 
derstanding from  the  police  or  other 
agencies.  Through  an  international 
feminist  movement,  the  women  of 
each  country  need  not  reinvent  the 
wheel:  we  can  learn  from  each  other 
about  how  we  are  oppressed,  and  dis- 
cuss strategies  for  what  to  do  about  it 
that  have  been  tried  in  different 
countries. 

According  to  de  Beauvoir,  the 
tribunal  was  "the  start  of  a  radical 
decolonization  of  women."  This  was 
so  because  the  Tribunal  was  not  only 
a  radical  feminist  political  action,  but 
international  as  well.  Patriarchy  is  an 
international  system,  and  its  eradica- 
tion requires  an  international 
perspective  and  struggle.  One  of  the 
mechanisms  developed  to  facilitate 
the  international  mobilization  of 
women  around  particular  issues  was 
the  International  Feminist  Network 
(IFN).  A  few  feminists  in  each  coun- 
try have  volunteered  to  distribute 
requests  for  support  sent  them  by  the 
IFN  Coordinators  in  Rome  or  Geneva 
to  the  women's  movements  in  their 
countries.  The  IFN  can  help  to 
organize  actions  in  the  form  of  fun- 
draising,    publicity,   demonstrations, 


etc.  —  similar  to  the  international 
feminist  mobilization  that  occurred 
in  1972  and  1973  in  support  of  the 
three  Marias  in  Portugal,  and  which 
contributed  to  their  acquittal  on 
charges  of  obscenity. 

In  the  U.S.,  local  Tribunals  took 
place  in  New  York  and  San  Fran- 
cisco, and  related  actions  occurred  in 
Los  Angeles,  Denver,  Philadelphia 
and  South  Carolina.  The  San  Fran- 
cisco Tribunal  inspired  a  later  con- 
ference on  violence  against  women, 
which  in  turn  has  given  birth  to  an 
effective  action  group,  Women 
Against  Violence  in  Pornography  and 
Media  (WAVPM). 

There  is  no  way  of  knowing  all  of 
the  actions  inspired  by  the  tribunal 
especially  in  other  countries. 
However,  we  do  know  that  there 
were  Tribunals  held  in  Dublin, 
Ireland,  and  Munich,  West  Ger- 
many; a  women's  movement  was 
started  in  Greece;  women  are  setting 
up  refuges  for  battered  women  in 
Norway,  West  Germany  and 
Belgium;  and  rape  crisis  centers  and 
medical  self-help  groups  are  being 
formed  in  several  countries.  And,  of 
course,  the  recognition  of  the 
problems  that  these  actions  indicate, 
has  been  carried  to  over  forty  coun- 
tries. A  British  woman,  in  touch  with 
the  women's  movement  in  Spain, 
told  me  that  the  Tribunal  had  had  a 
very  positive  effect  on  the  movement 
there.  Large  numbers  of  women 
turned  up  at  feminist  meetings  after 
the  Tribunal.  Though  highly  critical 
of   the  Tribunal,   the  Spanish  par- 


UO/Quest 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


ticipants  had  been  challenged  by  the 
opportunity  to  meet  women  from 
other  countries  where  women  are  less 
oppressed  than  in  Spain. 

Merely  the  idea  of  an  International 
Tribunal  on  Crimes  Against  Women 
completely  organized  by  and  for 
women,  is  radical.  With  the  con- 
siderable coverage  of  the  Tribunal  in 
both  the  feminist  and  the  establish- 
ment press  throughout  the  world,  we 
can  be  sure  that  it  has  been  heard  of 
by  millions  of  women  all  over  the 
world.

Notes  For  Prospective  Contributors 

About  one  year  before  an  issue  comes  off  the  presses,  a  theme 
development  committee,  composed  of  some  Quest  staff  members  and 
other  interested  women  prepares  a  list  of  questions  and  ideas  which  we 
hope  that  that  particular  issue  will  cover.  The  list  is  available  to  anyone 
who  is  interested  in  submitting  manuscripts,  outlines  for  potential  ar- 
ticles, poetry,  graphics,  etc.  (Please  let  us  know  if  you  want  to  receive 
these  lists  routinely  or  only  for  one  theme  in  particular,  and  if  the  latter, 
indicate  which  theme.)  We  accept  unsolicited  material  and  seek  out 
writers  and  artists  known  to  have  worked  on  issues  related  to  our 
themes. 

All  material  submitted  to  Quest  is  reviewed  by  a  theme  development 
committee  or  by  at  least  two  staff  members.  If  it  is  not  appropriate  for 
Quest  purposes,  the  manuscript  or  graphic  is  returned,  provided  it  was 
sent  with  a  stamped,  self-addressed  envelope.  If  a  manuscript  is 
accepted  for  publication,  it  is  assigned  to  one  Quest  editor,  who  is 
responsible  for  working  with  the  author  through  any  processes  of 
rewriting  or  editing  required.  Editing  and  rewriting  decisions  include 
gathering  comments  and  suggestions  from  various  Quest  staff  and 
development  committee  members.  Our  goal  in  editing  is  clarity; 
whatever  the  author  is  saying,  we  work  to  make  it  as  clear  and  concise  as 
possible.  Authors  always  receive  final  edited  manuscripts  for  review  and 
approval  before  publication. 

In  each  issue,  we  try  to  provide  a  balance  of  different  styles  of  writing, 
but  often  we  do  not  receive  enough  variety  in  the  manuscripts  submitted 
to  us.  It  is  important  to  exchange  our  stories,  our  growth,  our  changes, 
and  our  understanding.  But  often  such  exchanges  take  place  in  verbal 
dialogue  and  analysis  that  never  gets  on  paper.  While  writing  is  not  easy 
for  most  women,  our  challenge  is  to  find  ways  to  express  our 
experiences  and  our  analysis  so  that  they  aid  us  more  in  changing  socie- 
ty. We  encourage  you,  our  readers,  to  submit  a  variety  of  types  of  writing 

—  essays,  journalistic  approaches,  interviews,  tapes  of  discussions,  etc. 

—  so  that  all  of  us  can  learn  more  from  each  other  as  individuals  and  as  a 
movement. 


Articles  should  be  double  spaced  and  submitted  in  duplicate  (original 
plus  one  copy).  Length  of  submissions  should  be  from  2,500  words  (10 
typewritten  pages)  for  reviews,  responses,  and  short  articles,  to,  at  most, 
7,500  words  (25  pages)  for  longer  articles.  Where  appropriate, 
bibliographic  footnotes  should  be  typed  at  the  end  of  the  article.  All 
manuscripts,  poems,  and  graphics  should  be  original,  unpublished 
material  and  must  be  accompanied  by  a  stamped,  self-addressed 
envelope.  Write  to  us  for  copy  deadlines. 


Future  Issues 


THE  BODY  POLITIC  Vol.  IV,  No.  3 

Our  bodies  —  how  we  use,  view,  and  treat  them  —  are  basic  to  our  vi- 
sion. We  want  this  issue  to  explore  body  politics  in  its  broadest  sense, 
through  articles  that  discuss:  the  body  industry,  from  birth  to  death; 
feminist  and  environmental  politics;  the  future  of  reproduction,  and  its 
effect  on  the  female  nature;  dying;  age,  class,  and  body  perspectives;

WOMEN  IN  THEIR  COMMUNITIES 

Vol.  IV,  No.  4 

A  critical  aspect  of  community  is  affinity  or  identification.  A  com- 
munity is  a  group  of  people  who  share  something.  Some  of  the  things 
shared  are  common  place,  common  work,  and/or  common  perception. 
This  issue  will  explore  how  we  define  our  communities;  how  they 
develop  and  interact;  how  well  they  serve  women  working  on  common 
goals,  and  how  we  relate  as  individual  women  within  them. 

KALEIDOSCOPE  THREE 

Vol.  V,  No.  1 

Are  we  connecting  our  lives  to  our  ideas?  This  issue  will  be  an  open 
forum  for  substantive  responses  to  our  first  four  years  of  publication 
and  for  your  input  to  help  chart  our  future.  We  seek  discussion  of  topics 
and  ideas  you  consider  vital,  as  well  as  commentary  on  previous  articles. 

THE  INDIVIDUAL  AND  REVOLUTION 

Vol.  V,  No.  2 

What  is  a  feminist  revolutionary?  How  do  we  make  choices  about  life, 
work,  and  politics?  Where  does  our  sustenance  for  revolutionary  work 
come  from?  How  do  we  relate  individual  values  to  revolutionary  values? 
Each  of  us  makes  choices  and  decisions  which  reflect  our  basic  values 
about  our  roles  as  individuals  in  making  a  feminist  revolution.  The  pur- 
pose of  this  issue  is  to  make  explicit  these  unspoken  underpinnings  of 
our  lives.
