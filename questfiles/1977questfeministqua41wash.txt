Quest  Communique 


Fourth  Year  Beginnings 

With  this  issue,  we  have  begun  our  fourth  year  and  launched  several 
new  features  —  most  notably,  the  sixteen  additional  pages  which  include 
a  new  section,  called  "Organizer's  Dialogue."  (See  "Report  to  Our 
Readers,  Part  III,"  for  a  detailed  description  and  the  long-awaited  results 
of  our  Readers'  Survey.)  We  have  also  redesigned  the  table-of-contents 
page  and  (reluctantly)  eliminated  the  one-page  color  insert  to  pay  for  the 
additional  pages.  We  hope  that  you  like  this  expanded  format  and  will 
make  use  of  the  new  features,  as  well  as  continue  to  respond  to  the  old. 
We  welcome  your  feedback,  and  would  especially  like  to  receive  more 
letters  from  our  readers. 

New  Office  and  Expenses 

In  May,  we  moved  out  of  the  Institute  for  Policy  Studies  and  into  our 
own  office.  We  are  now  settled  and  have  purchased  or  borrowed  most  of 
the  equipment  we  need,  but  our  overhead  expenses  have  skyrocketed. 
We've  found,  as  women  everywhere  know,  that  complete  independence 
from  existing  institutions  is  precious  but  expensive.  We  consider  our 
new  situation  a  part  of  the  movement's  continuing  efforts  to  create  self- 
sustaining  institutions  and  organizations,  and  as  such,  feel  that  it  is  vital 
to  us.  It  is  a  challenge  to  the  staff  as  well  as  to  our  readers  to  keep  Quest 
alive  and  growing.  In  this  effort,  we  need  your  assistance  not  only  with 
money,  letters,  and  articles,  but  also  with  suggestions  for  resources  and 
by  promoting  Quest  to  libraries  and  potential  new  subscribers. 

Sustaining  Contributors 

At  this  crucial  financial  juncture,  we  urge  those  readers  who  are  able 
to  become  Sustaining  Contributors.  We  have  suggested  $25  a  year.  We 
welcome  more,  or  less,  as  you  can  manage.  If  you  have  just  subscribed  or 
renewed  your  subscription,  please  consider  subscribing  for  another  year 
and  becoming  a  Sustaining  Contributor  now,  or  taking  gift- 
subscriptions  for  your  friends.  Quest  is  a  non-profit,  tax-exempt  cor- 
poration, so  any  amount  contributed  beyond  the  $9  annual  subscription 
is  a  tax  deductible  contribution.  By  the  Fall,  1977,  we  hope  to  be 
covering  not  only  all  our  office  expenses,  but  also  to  be  paying  three 
modest  full-time  staff  salaries.  This  is  essential  to  our  politics,  to  main- 
taining Quest's  quality,  to  expanding  our  readership,  and  to  being  able 
to  better  serve  all  our  readers  with  new  ideas  and  new  features.  Thank 
you  for  your  continuing  support.

Quest:  a  feminist  quarterly  is  seeking  long-term,  in-depth  feminist  po- 
litical analysis  and  ideological  development.  Quest  is  not  an  end  in  it- 
self, but  a  process  leading  to  new  directions  for  the  women's  move- 
ment, possibly  including  such  concrete  forms  as  regional  or  national 
conferences,  a  national  organization,  or  a  political  party.  We,  the  edi- 
tors, are  all  women  who  have  been  in  the  movement  several  years 
and  have  reached  a  point  where  each  answer  leads  us  to  more  ques- 
tions. We  have  been  through  various  ideological  and  activist  meta- 
morphoses and  end  up  feeling  that  our  overall  perspective  is  still  not 
adequate.  Where  has  the  struggle  brought  us?  Closer  to  real  econom- 
ic, political,  and  social  power  for  women?  Closer  to  the  end  of  the  ex- 
ploitation of  and  violence  against  women?  Closer  to  self-determina- 
tion for  all  women?  We  do  not  have  all  the  answers  ourselves  and  ex- 
pect that  feminists  across  the  country  and  the  world  will  contribute  to 
this  process  of  seeking.

Report  to  Our  Readers  3. 


Introduction 

The  Quest  Communique  in  Vol. 
Ill,  No.  4  "Race,  Class  and  Culture," 
mentioned  that  our  staff  held  a  three- 
day  working  retreat  in  early  May, 
which  led  to  an  expanded  journal  of 
96  pages,  and  a  new  feature  within 
the  journal,  to  he  called  "Organizers' 
Dialogue."  In  addition,  Quest  will  he 
making  available  two  new  services 
which  we  hope  will  further  increase 
the  usefulness  of  Quest  to  its  readers: 
study  guides  and  a  Quest  index. 
Appearing  in  this  issue  are  the  results 
of  our  Reader  Survey  which  so  many 
of  you  took  the  time  to  return  to  us. 
The  new  Quest  features  and  services 
are,  in  part,  a  response  to  suggestions 
received  in  the  survey. 

Following  is  a  brief  description  of 
the  Organizers'  Dialogue,  the  Study 
Guides  and  the  Quest  Index. 

Organizers7  Dialogue 

One  of  the  ways  we  want  to  use 
the  additional  journal  space  will  be  to 
provide  an  ongoing  series  of  articles 
and  shorter  features  which  will 
enable  activists  to  share  their 
successes,  problems,  failures,  in- 
sights, and  resources  around  the  par- 
ticular issues  they  are  confronting  in 
their  political  communities.  We  see 
two  basic  types  of  material.  First,  we 
want  article-length,  how-to  pieces 
which  examine,  in  depth,  the  signifi- 
cant dimensions  of  creating  and 
maintaining  long-  and  short-term 
feminist  structures,  whether  they  are 
present  organizations,  or  the  begin- 


nings of  developing  future 
organizations  or  strategies.  These 
could  include  the  effects  of  applying 
the  politics,  strategies  and  tactics 
which  guide  the  organizing  effort; 
the  aspects  of  the  personal  dimen- 
sions involved,  such  as  relationships, 
between  paid  and  unpaid  staff,  or 
between  "professional"  and  "non- 
professional" women;  or  handling  of 
obstacles  to  organizing  within  and 
without  the  feminist  community.  An 
example  of  the  kind  of  material  we 
want  is  the  article  in  this  issue  on 
feminist  credit  unions.  Our  major 
concern  is  that  these  articles  be 
thoughtful  explorations  of  current 
experiences  written  by  and  for  ac- 
tivist feminists. 

This  doesn't  mean,  of  course,  that 
we  are  not  interested  in  materials 
with  untested  theoretical  assump- 
tions. It  means  that  we  feel  strongly 
the  need  for  more  discussion  among 
activist  feminists  involved  in  similar 
objectives  who  are  encountering, 
perhaps,  similar  problems  and 
successes.  By  their  very  nature,  these 
articles  will  be  more  concerned  with 
immediate  aspects  of  the  here-and- 
now,  such  as  identifying  what 
doesn't  work  and  sharing  what  does, 
than  with  theories  not  yet  grounded 
in  direct  experience. 

What  will  make  these  articles  work 
is  sustained  reader  contributions.  We 
do  not  intend  that  these  articles  be 
developed  and  written  by  the  Quest 
staff,  any  more  than  the  journal  has 
ever  been  solely  a  staff  product.  But 
even   more   than   ever,   we   feel   the 


A/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  1,  summer,  1977 


urgency  of  directing  ourselves  to  ac- 
tive political  grass-roots  involve- 
ment, to  becoming  more  responsive 
to  the  needs  of  non-feminist  women 
of  all  races  and  classes,  and  in  the 
process,  to  the  needs  and  objectives 
of  activists  who  are  taking  direct, 
one-to-one  risks  on  a  daily  basis.  We 
want  these  articles  to  reflect  that  con- 
cern, and  to  do  that,  they  must  be 
written  by  you  and  address  your  im- 
mediate needs.  If  they  do  that,  they 
will  create  links  among  feminists  as  a 
first  step  toward  building  sustained 
alternative  structures. 

The  second  kind  of  material  we 
hope  to  publish  is  short,  single- 
subject  exchanges  in  each  Quest 
issue.  We  will  be  experimenting  in 
the  coming  issues  with  various  ways 
to  coordinate  and  solicit  information 
from  women  nationally  and  inter- 
nationally around  particular  subjects. 
We  expect  that  kind  of  publicity  and 
coordination  will  be  the  most  dif- 
ficult aspect  of  this  proposed  addi- 
tion to  Quest,  and  we  will  not  be  able 
to  achieve  it  without  your  serious 
commitment  and  interest. 

We  hope  that  this  series  will  even- 
tually evolve  into  a  kind  of  "issue  of 
the  month"  exchange.  We  envision  it 
as  one  or  more  short,  meaty  pieces 
sharing  tips,  pitfalls,  questions  and 
answers  drawn  directly  from  prac- 
tical experience.  Clearly,  the  content 
of  these  pieces  may  well  overlap  that 
of  the  longer  articles;  the  major 
difference  is  length.  We  might,  for 
example,  want  to  develop  communica- 
tion among  activists  for  dealing  with 
the  entrenched  fear  of,  or  hostility  to, 
feminism  of  many  women  en- 
countered in  all  kinds  of  contexts, 
over-the-counter  transactions,  fund- 
raising,  promotion,  CR,  development 


of  community  facilities  (e.g.,  daycare, 
food  coops),  and  the  like.  In  that 
case,  we  would  like  to  hear  how  you 
deal:  one-liners  you  use  to  defuse 
hostilities,  raps,  tactics,  political 
strategies  —  everything,  from  the 
sublime  to  the  mundane,  so  long  as  it 
adds  to  our  collective  repository  of 
skills  for  getting  our  politics  where 
they  must  ultimately  go. 

Again,  neither  of  these  new  ad- 
ditions to  Quest  will  work  without 
you.  Please  send  us  ideas  for  the  issue 
of  the  month,  article-length 
explorations  of  areas  you  as  activists 
feel  the  need  to  explore,  and  short, 
pistol-shot  tips  or  problems  for  other 
women  in  other  places  to  use, 
critique,  or  help  to  solve. 

Study  Guides 

Much  of  the  process  of  producing 
each  issue  of  Quest  goes  unnoticed 
by  our  readers.  While  we  would  like 
to  share  our  discussions  on  copy  and 
topics,  it  is  impossible  to  do  so.  Un- 
fortunately, all  that  reaches  the 
reader  is  the  finished  copy. 

One  of  the  devices  Quest  uses  to 
pull  together  an  issue  is  the  Develop- 
ment Committee,  a  group  of  people 
with  interest,  and  generally  some 
expertise  or  involvement  in  a  par- 
ticular topic  of  concern  to  Quest. 
Among  other  things,  the  Develop- 
ment Committee  prepares  a  list  of 
questions  to  develop  the  theme,  and 
assist  prospective  authors.  While 
these  questions  are  generally  quite 
expansive  and  are  never  totally 
answered  by  any  article  or  even  a 
whole  issue  of  Quest,  they  are  vital  to 
exploring  the  full  range  of  the  issue's 
topic. 

Development       Committee 


Report  to  Our  Readers/5 


questions  have  been  available  to 
prospective  writers  issue-by-issue 
since  our  second  issue.  We  feel, 
however,  that  they  outline  many  im- 
portant issues  that  still  have  not  been 
thoroughly  addressed  either  in  Quest 
or,  in  most  cases,  by  the  movement. 
We  therefore  are  making  these 
questions  available  to  anyone  in- 
terested in  using  them.  We  especially 
see  them  as  valuable  study  guides  for 
women's  studies,  feminist  study 
groups,  or  other  feminist  writing  and 
strategizing  endeavors. 

Included  with  the  questions  will  be 
a  brief  overview  of  the  Quest  issue  as 
it  actually  emerged,  and  short 
excerpts  from  some  articles  that 
might  also  aid  a  study  group.  To 
complete  this  collection  of  Quest 
materials  from  the  first  three  years, 
we  have  prepared  an  index  to  the  first 
three  volumes  of  Quest.  This  collec- 
tion will  be  available  only  as  a  total 
unit.  Watch  future  issues  of  Quest 
for  ordering  information. 

Quest  Index 

Several  years  of  Quest  equals 
several  hundred  pages  of  feminist 
political  analysis  and  thousands  of 
concepts  and  resolutions  rising  out  of 
feminist  political  activity.  In  order  to 
provide  access  to  this  growing 
reserve  of  information,  we  are 
producing  an  index. 

The  index  will  allow  readers  to 
work  with  three  years  of  Quest  —  to 
integrate  into  their  own  developing 
feminist  analysis  and  political  work 
the  analysis  and  experience  of  others. 
In  this  way,  Quest  can  become  more 
of  a  tool  for  successful  political  ac- 
tion and  for  the  building  of  a  com- 
prehensive  feminist   ideology.    This 


index  will  be  available  along  with  the 
study  guides. 

Reader  Survey 

As  most  of  you  know,  several 
months  ago  we  undertook  a  survey 
of  our  readers  to  find  out  who  you 
are,  what  you  think  of  Quest,  and 
your  suggestions  for  our  future.  The 
response  to  the  survey  was 
enthusiastic  (six  hundred  and  forty- 
seven  responses)  and  this  article  is  to 
share  with  you  what  we  learned  from 
it.

Occupation 

Quest's  readers  are  employed  in  a 
wide  range  of  occupational 
categories.  Educators  represent  the 
largest  single  category  (153  or 
23.6%).  Approximately  one-third  of 
this  number  are  college  professors, 
while  another  one-third  teach  at  the 
elementary  or  secondary  school  level. 
The  remainder  represent  school  ad- 
ministrators, teacher  aides,  or  in- 
dividuals in  non-specified  education 
professions. 

Activists  and  community  or- 
ganizers represent  the  next  largest 
employment  category  {55  or  8%). 
Many  of  these  women  are  activists 
full-time  while  some  are  employed  in 
other  areas  as  well. 

Research  analysts  and  admin- 
istrators represent  approximately  40 
Quest  readers.  Our  readers  are  also 
employed  in  a  broad  range  of  other 
areas,  including  masseuses, 
carpenters,  waitresses,  chemists,  art 
designers,  urban  planners,  secre- 
taries, receptionists,  dancers, 
typesetters,  and  bus  operators.  One 
park  ranger  responded  to  the  survey 
as  did  one  mail  carrier. 

Geor graphic  Distribution 

Respondents  are  scattered 
throughout  45  states  and  7  foreign 
countries.  California,  New  York, 
Massachusetts,  Pennsylvania,  the 
District  of  Columbia,  Ohio  and 
Michigan,  were,  in  descending  order, 
the  states  with  the  most  responses. 
Half  of  those  responding  outside  of 
the  United  States  live  in  Canada.  The 
other  12  live  in  such  diverse  places  as 
Australia,  New  Zealand,  West  Ger- 
many, England,  Finland  and  Iceland. 

A  large  percentage  of  the  sub- 
scribers live  in  non-metropolitan  or 


rural  areas.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
overwhelming  majority  of  non- 
subscribers  live  in  metropolitan 
areas,  such  as  San  Francisco,  New 
York  City,  and  Denver. 

Readers'  Activities 

Reading  is  an  important  pastime  of 
Quest  readers.  The  most  recently 
read  books  were  Susan  Brownmiller's 
Against  our  Will:  Women  and  Rape; 
Rita  Mae  Brown's  In  Her  Day;  June 
Arnold's  Sister  Gin;  Small  Changes 
and  Woman  on  the  Edge  of  Time  by 
Marge  Piercy;  and  Agatha  Christie 
Mysteries. 

Periodicals  read  or  subscribed  to 
most  frequently  were  Ms.  (nearly 
one-quarter  of  our  readership)  and 
Off  Our  Backs.  Also  mentioned  were 
a  daily  or  Sunday  newspsper,  Time 
or  other  news  magazine,  Majority 
Report,  Big  Mama  Rag,  The  Guar- 
dian, Lesbian  Connection,  The 
Spokeswoman,  New  Yorker  maga- 
zine, Signs  and  the  New  York  Re- 
view of  Books.  Noteworthy  is  the 
lack  of  any  pattern  in  the  kinds  of 
magazines  and  newspapers  read  or 
subscribed  to. 

Reading,  however,  is  not  the  only 
activity  which  occupies  the  free  time 
of  Quest's  survey  respondents. 
Sports  ranked  high,  with  Softball, 
jogging,  tennis,  biking  and  swim- 
ming listed  as  the  most  popular. 
Quest  readers  also  enjoy  cooking, 
sex,  and  listening  to  music  —  for- 
tunately, not  all  at  the  same  time.  Ap- 
proximately one-third  of  those  who 
responded  to  the  survey  play  at  least 
one  musical  instrument— ranging 
from  violin  and  piano  to  kazoos  and 
spoons. 

Approximately  85%  of  those  who 
responded  to  the  survey  are  active  in 


8/Quest 


women's  organizations.  In  both  sur- 
vey categories,  the  National 
Organization  for  Women  involved 
the  greatest  number  of  Quest  readers. 
They  also  participate  in  women's 
studies  on  campuses,  feminist  study 
groups,  church  groups,  and  women's 
health  collectives,  in  that  order. 
Other  activities,  such  as  feminist 
bookstores,  women's  press  guilds, 
rape  crisis  centers  and  self-help 
groups  were  also  mentioned. 

Reader  Feedback 

A  large  number  of  our  current  sub- 
scribers were  introduced  to  Quest 
during  our  first  year  of  publication. 
When  asked  how  they  first  heard 
about  Quest,  40%  indicated  that  they 
learned  about  the  journal  through 
friends.  Others  heard  of  Quest 
through  advertising,  discussion 
groups,  women's  bookstores,  con- 
ferences, and  classes.  A  few  of  our 
subscribers  were  introduced  to  Quest 
through  gift  subscriptions. 

The  question,  "Why  do  you  sub- 
scribe to  Quest?"  elicited  two  general 
kinds  of  responses.  Some  people  in- 
dicated specifically  why  they  sub- 
scribe rather  than  obtain  copies 
through  friends,  bookstores,  etc. 
Others  explained  why  they  were  in- 
itially attracted  to  the  journal,  or  why 
they  are  currently  pleased  with  it. 
Among  the  former  category,  a 
number  indicated  that  they  like  to 
keep  Quest  as  a  reference  source, 
while  many  like  to  lend  or  share  their 
copies.  Others  subscribe  "to  be  sure 
to  get  all  the  issues,"  or  "because  I 
can't  get  it  in  a  bookshop."  The 
feeling  of  a  large  number  of 
respondents  is  reflected  in  the  com- 
ment, "I  believe  women  should  sup- 
port   our    feminist    media."    One 


woman  subscribes  "to  support  the 
magazine  —  I  can  get  issues  sooner  in 
the  bookstore."  Another  woman 
commented,  "I  realize  subscriptions 
benefit  Quest  more  than  sales." 

Among  those  respondents  who  in- 
dicated why  they  liked  Quest,  a  large 
majority  expressed  a  need  for 
feminist  theory,  "to  keep  in  touch 
with  feminist  thinking  on  various 
subjects."  Subscribers  feel  that  Quest 
stimulates  political  thought  and  dis- 
cussion, and  provides  insights  that 
contribute  to  their  personal  growth, 
specific  political  work,  and  to 
ongoing  movement-building.  Several 
people  also  noted  that  Quest 
stimulates  ideas  for  research  and 
teaching.  It  was  also  clear  from  the 
survey  that  the  journal  fills  needs 
that  are  not  being  filled  elsewhere  — 
"in  depth  analysis  of  issues  which 
aren't  specifically  tied  to  events  or 
news  items."  It  is  "more  than  just  a 
personal  sharing  journal.  We  need 
more  feminist  thinking."  "It's  the 
only  feminist  journal  I  know  of  that 
concentrates  on  theory  and  vision  in 
an  open,  non-dogmatic  way."  "I 
want  to  read  and  develop  theoretical 
work,  not  just  academic  thought." 

What  do  Quest  readers  want? 

In  response  to  the  question,  "What 
would  you  like  to  see  more  of  in 
Quest?"  respondents  overwhelming- 
ly wanted  more  interviews,  fiction 
and  poetry.  Readers  also  requested 
feminist  project  reports  and  personal 
accounts;  pieces  relating  to  theory 
building  and  action  (including 
project  analysis);  history  of  the 
current  women's  movement;  reviews 
of  feminist  literature,  films,  and 
theoretical  writing;  and  letters  to  the 
editors.  Additionally,  readers  wanted 


Report  to  our  Readers/9 


to  see  biography,  humor,  and  more 
research-based  writing.  "I  particular- 
ly like  articles  which  contain  hard 
data  about  where  we  are  as  a  com- 
munity, such  as  in  June  Arnold's  ar- 
ticle about  women's  presses. 
Knowing  facts  about  the  circulation 
of  women's  literature  conveys  more 
to  me  than  expressions  about  'the 
spread  of  women's  consciousness.'  ' 
Readers  would  like  more  articles  on 
lesbianism,  health,  Marxism,  culture, 
spiritualism,  general  economic 
analysis,  current  activism,  class, 
history,  black  and  other  Third  World 
women,  analysis  of  women's  centers, 
art,  psychic  power  and  witchcraft,  in- 
ternational feminism,  healing  and 
herbalism,  sports,  and  the  Marx- 
ist/feminist split. 

Several  readers  urgently  called  for 
an  examination  of  alternatives  to  the 
traditional  family,  and  strategies  for 
living  with  reality  while  working  for 
change.  ("It  would  be  nice  if  a  whole 
year  didn't  have  to  pass  before 
examining  the  area,  'Are  we  connect- 
ing our  lives  with  our  ideas.'  ")  Other 
issues  readers  would  like  to  see  ad- 
dressed include  insanity,  prostitu- 
tion, lesbian  mothers,  childbirth, 
battered  women,  and  handicapped 
women. 

A  number  of  respondents  wanted 
more  of  Quest.  Though  satisfied  with 
the  style,  format  and  contents,  they 
would  like  to  see  larger  issues.  One 
woman  suggested  we  publish  the 
Development  Committee  questions. 
Other  suggestions  included  making 
reprints  of  articles  available,  and 
selling  prints  of  Quest  graphics.  As 
you  can  see  from  the  introductory 
discussion  in  this  issue,  some  of  the 
reader  suggestions  are  being  incor- 
porated into  our  new  format. 


Graphics 

A  majority  of  the  respondents 
were  pleased  with  the  visual  effect  of 
Quest,  offering  varying  com- 
pliments. However,  a  number  of  peo- 
ple did  express  dissatisfaction  with, 
or  indifference  to,  the  design  and 
graphics.  "For  the  most  part  I  don't 
consciously  notice  [the  graphics]." 
Those  who  like  the  layout  found  it 
"approachable,"  indicating  that  the 
graphics  generally  complement  the 
articles  well.  "Seems  like  the  artists 
work  very  hard  to  relate  to  the  sub- 
ject." The  graphics  were  considered 
"one  of  the  magazine's  high-lights." 
Readers  were  pleased  with  the  variety 
of  artistic  styles  represented  in  Quest, 
and  they  like  the  "simplicity," 
"clarity,"  and  "directness"  of  the 
overall  design. 

Other  respondents  had  quite 
different  opinions.  Some  found  the 
graphics  too  literal;  others  found 
them  too  abstract.  Graphics  were 
characterized  as  "cold."  Their 
starkness  is  sometimes  depressing." 
"There  are  too  many  which  portray 
anger,  and  not  enough  of  women 
sharing  energy."  They  "sometimes 
seem  purposefully  gross  and  ugly." 
One  reader  commented  that  the 
graphics  "almost  always  depict  white 
people."  Some  readers  dislike  what 
they  consider  the  commercial-art 
flavor  of  the  graphics.  "I  get  a  bit  of  a 
too  slick  impression  from  Quest.  I 
wonder  where  you  get  your  money." 
But  others  found  the  graphics  "not  as 
polished  as  they  could  be;"  "ama- 
teurish." 

Criticism  of  Quest  Content  and  Style 
A  number  of  respondents  felt  that 
Quest  does  not  measure  up: 
"Sometimes  I  feel  as  if  the  writing 


10/Quest 


format  promises  political  analysis  but 
doesn't  always  deliver  the  high  level 
of  conceptualization." 
"You  seem  to  be  asking  the  right 
questions  but  the  content  is  often  in- 
sufficiently substantive." 
"  .  .  .  too  much  equivocation.  Many 
articles  seem  to  talk  around  issues 
rather  than  illuminate  them." 
"So  often  Quest  articles  seem  'safe' 
and  'old.'  " 

"I  stopped  subscribing  to  Quest 
because  the  quality  of  the  articles  is 
poor.  They  tend  to  be  unbalanced, 
polemical  and  finally,  trivial— more 
depth,  more  responsible  analysis, 
more  inspiration  is  called  for  —more 
quality." 

One  respondent  thought,  "Some 
articles  are  condensed  so  much  they 
end  up  being  unmemorable 
generalizations."  She  suggested  that 
there  be  "fewer  articles  so  they  can 
play  themselves  all  the  way  out." 

Others  were  quite  specific  in  their 
ciriticisms.  A  number  of  people  felt 
that  Quest's  style  is  too  academic: 
"While  Quest  issues  are  often  on 
topics  which  affect  all  of  our  lives, 
the  language  is  often  mystifying  and 
too  academically  oriented." 
"I  think  Quest  is  awfully  middle- 
class— It  assumes  at  least  a  college 
education  in  order  to  really  unders- 
tand the  articles." 

"Very  much  want  articles  on 
economics  and  political  strategy  that 
aren't  written  in  sociologese  and 
don't  end  up  as  flat  generalizations." 

Another  common  criticism  was 
that  Quest's  analytical  approach  is 
not  adequately  grounded  in 
experience  and  feelings,  and  that, 
more  specifically,  Quest  fails  to  ad- 
dress a  broad  range  of  women's 
experiences: 


"I  enjoy  Quest  but  for  the  almost  too 
linear,  too  rational,  approach.  Logic 
and  analysis  are  great,  but  so  are 
intuition-vision.  .  .  .  Don't  forfeit 
emotion.  We  won't  spoil  a  thing  in 
spilling  a  little  menstrual  blood." 
"You  need  to  incorporate  more  of  the 
experience  of  'ordinary'  women.  I 
often  feel  that  you  are  writing  for  a 
small  group  of  women  and  that 
doesn't  include  me." 
"An  undue  emphasis  is  put  on  the 
struggles  and  weaknesses  of  a 
Marxist  analysis  for  feminist 
thought.  .  .  .  Maybe  concurrently 
starting  from  several  bases  would  be 
more  useful." 

Respondents  felt  that  theory 
should  be  more  action-oriented: 
"I  would  like  to  see  articles  concen- 
trating on  issues  important  to  all  wo- 
men —  rape,  battered  wives,  etc.  — 
How  have  women  organized  to  deal 
with  the  crisis?" 

"I  do  not  need  descriptions  of  the 
problems  but  reports  on  imaginative 
ways  to  act." 

"There  is  an  abundance  of  phil- 
osophy in  print  on  the  various 
aspects  of  feminism.  It's  time  to  turn 
to  the  practicality  of  carrying  it  out." 

What  readers  like  about  Quest 

Several  respondents  thought  that 
Quest  is  improving.  "I  found  the  last 
several  copies  of  Quest  much  more 
readable."  And  one  woman  com- 
mented: "I  appreciate  a  magazine 
that  cares  enough  to  edit  as  carefully 
as  you  people  do." 

Readers  were  especially  impressed 
with  Quest's  openness  and  diversity. 
"You  seem  to  be  interested  in  serious 
exploration  of  movement  issues  for 
purposes  of  growth  and  understan- 
ding rather  than  divisiveness." 


Report  to  our  Readers/ll 


"[Quest]  is  the  most  theoretical 
feminist  journal  publishing  a  diversi- 
ty of  ideas— and  I  sense  not  correct- 
line  dogma." 

"The  fact  that  you  solicit  articles 
from  readers  is  excellent.  It  allows 
women  from  diverse  spaces  and 
geographic  areas  a  forum  for  the 
exchange  of  ideas." 
"I'm  favorably  impressed  by  the  fact 
that  'average'  women  are  published 
in  your  pages  along  with  'stars'  of  the 
movement.  I  hope  you  can  keep  your 
editorial  selection  process  open." 
"Quest's  goals  are  hard  to  attain  and 
sometimes  you  don't  make  it.  Still, 
the  women's  movement  is  becoming 
more  articulate  and  you  are  providing 
opportunities  to  hear  and  be  heard." 
Additional  responses  to  Quest  are 
reflected  in  the  following  comments: 
"[Quest]  takes  seriously  the  issues  of 
class,  race,  and  sexual  preference 
which  the  women's  movement  tends 
to  ignore  sometimes  (I  must  qualify 
that)."  "You've  been  able  to  consist- 
ently provide  me  with  provocative 
stimulating  material." 
"Please  don't  change  too  much,  but 
keep  pushing  the  hard  theoretical/ 
political  problems." 
"Just  keep  up  the  good  work. 
You're  the  dill  pickle  in  my  life." 


make-up  of  Quest  readership?  I  feel 
it's  necessary  to  know  if  you're 
reaching  beyond  white  boundaries." 
Finally,  one  woman  commented: 
"I  hate  questionnaires.  I  would  only 
do  this  for  feminists."  To  her,  and  to 
all  the  others  who  returned  the 
questionnaires,  we  again  extend  our 
thanks.  We  found  it  fascinating  to 
find  out  who  you  are  and  what  you 
think  of  this  journal. 


The  Questionnaire 

Several  people  directed  criticisms 
at  the  questionnaire  itself.  In  general, 
people  felt  it  didn't  account  for  the 
variety  of  lifestyles  that  feminists 
lead.  Further,  it  was  designed  for  in- 
dividuals and  was  not  applicable  to 
organizations. 

Several  people  expressed  concern 
that  the  questionnaire  ignored  race 
and  ethnic  background.  "Why  is 
there  no  question  as  to  the  national

A  Report  From 
WOMEN'S  CCMMUMTY 
HEALTH  CENTER 


This  article  was  written  by 
Elizabeth  Sommers,  Susan  Bell,  Jill 
Wolhandler  and  Judi  Stein  as  part  of 
their  work  at  Women's  Community 
Health  Center,  Inc.  The  Center  is  a 
woman  owned  and  operated  self-help 
institution  committed  to  empowering 
women  with  control  over  our  health 
care  and  our  lives. 

graphics  by  Jo  Delaplaine 

Women's  Community  Health 
Center,  Inc.  is  a  self-help  health 
center  in  Cambridge,  Massachusetts, 
run  by  a  collective  of  twenty-one 
women.  We  see  ourselves  as  a 
feminist  institution  in  the  movement 
for  radical  social  change.  We  own 
and  operate  a  center  where  we  offer 
educational  and  medical  services,  and 
provide  choices  for  women  that  the 
present  health  care  system  does  not 
provide.  We  are  neither  an  alter- 
native to  the  present  health  care 
system,  nor  a  pressure  valve  which 
absorbs  discontented  women.  We  are 
a  feminist  institution  which  seeks 
radical  social  change  by  implemen- 
ting the  concept  of  self-help;  the 
sharing  of  skills  and  information  so 
that  women  can  regain  control  of  our 
health  care  and  our  lives.  Our  inter- 
nal   structure,    as    well    as    our 


relationships  with  others,  reflects  the 
principles  of  self-help. 

We  have  developed  educational 
and  medical  programs  equally.  These 
include  a  slide  show  introduction  to 
self-help  (based  on  and  including 
slides  from  the  first  such  presenta- 
tion developed  by  the  Los  Angeles 
Feminist  Women's  Health  Center);  a 
well-woman  exam  video  presenta- 
tion; ongoing  general  and  special  in- 
terest self-help  groups  (recent  groups 
have  included  paramedical  skills,  les- 
bian health  issues,  herbal  self-help, 
and  research  groups  on  menopause 
and  breast  conditions);  well-woman 
gynecological  care;  pregnancy 
screening;  and  abortion  services.  All 
of  these  programs  are  income- 
generating  and  each  provides  us  with 
a  mechanism  for  sharing  self-help 
skills  and  information.  Each  year  we 
have  sponsored  a  women's  health 
weekend  to  bring  women  together  to 
share  information  and  to 
organize  around  different  health 
concerns.  We  have  travelled  to  con- 
ferences in  many  areas  and  have 
focused  on  different  communities  in 
the  Boston  area.  Recently  we  have 
worked  more  actively  with  other 
health  groups  in  Boston  as  well  as 
nationally,  and  have  begun  to  be 
more  vocal  about  issues  that  present

themselves  in  the  women's  move- 
ment. All  of  this  growth  and  expan- 
sion has  required  concomitant 
development  of  our  internal  struc- 
ture. 

Our  collective  is  three  years  old. 
We  have  devoted  much  time  and 
energy  to  developing  ways  of 
working  together  that  do  not  produce 
the  alienation  or  oppression  that 
women  so  often  encounter  in  their 
work  places.  This  article  focuses  on 
methods  we  have  developed  to  foster 
our  strength  and  energy  so  that  we 
may  not  only  accomplish  the  daily 
maintenance  work  required  to 
operate  a  business,  but  also  continue 
to  develop  and  grow  as  a  strong  self- 
help  center  and  feminist  institution. 
We  are  not  a  finished  product  and 
have  been  more  successful  in  some 
ways  than  in  others.  This  analysis  is 
offered  both  as  a  resource  for  women 
and  as  a  tool  by  which  we  may  con- 
tinue our  own  self-evaluation. 

How  We  Work 

We  work  as  a  collective,  without 
hierarchy  but  not  without  structure. 
Since  our  commitment  to  self-help 
applies  to  our  internal  structure  as 
well  as  to  the  services  we  offer,  we 
expend  much  time  and  energy 
making  information  available  to 
every  woman  in  the  collective.  In- 
dividual women  or  small  committees 
do  much  of  our  daily  work.  Com- 
mittees provide  guidelines, 
recommendations,  or  results  of 
brainstorming  for  the  entire  collec- 
tive to  use  as  a  basis  for  discussion 
and  consensual  decision-making.  Not 
every  woman  is  part  of  every  com- 
mittee, nor  does  every  woman  do 
each  job  at  the  center.  Each  woman 


does  have  access  to  the  skills  and 
experience  of  each  committee  and 
job,  as  her  time  and  interest  permit. 

We  have  three  job  categories:  full- 
time,  part-time,  and  part-part-time. 
Full-time  members  work  at  least  45 
hours  each  week  (often  much  more); 
part-time  members  work  at  least  25 
hours  each  week  (often  much  more); 
and  part-part-time  members  attend 
the  business  meeting  and  work  at  one 
medical  session  weekly.  A  woman 
cannot  join  the  collective  as  a  part- 
part-time  member;  this  status  is 
reserved  for  long-term  members  who 
need  to  cut  back  their  time  commit- 
ment. Because  decisions  are  made  by 
those  with  experience  and  informa- 
tion, there  is  no  division  of  power 
between  part-time,  part-part-time, 
and  full-time  members.  It  is  a  collec- 
tive responsibility  to  make  both 
available  to  each  woman,  and  it  is 
each  woman's  responsibility  to 
gather  that  information  and 
experience.  This  policy  is  a  reflec- 
tion of  our  self-help  philosophy. 

Presently  we  require  that  each 
woman  work  in  administrative, 
educational,  and  medical  programs. 
In  reality,  the  distribution  of  work 
varies  for  each  woman,  especially  for 
part-time  women.  In  order  to  do 
committee  work  and  attend  meetings, 
part-time  women  often  cannot  work 
in  all  three  programs.  Many  part- 
time  women  attend  the  business 
meeting  and  one  other  meeting  each 
week  rather  than  attending  every 
meeting.  This  entails  missing  some 
important  educational,  medical,  or 
political  sessions;  and  not  par- 
ticipating in  some  of  the  decisions  of 
the  center.  Since  sharing  information 
and  skills  is  important,  women  are 
expected  to  read  meeting  notes  and  to

acquaint  themselves  with  collective 
decisions.  So  that  part-time  women 
with  inflexible  schedules  don't 
always  miss  the  same  meeting  (some 
of  the  part-time  women  are  students, 
teachers,  practitioners,*  and 
mothers),  we  rotate  meeting  days. 
What  we  have  found  is  that  no  one 
participates  in  every  decision;  and  as 
the  collective  has  grown  a  smaller 
percentage  is  vocal  on  a  given  issue. 


As  we  have  grown  and  expanded, 
it  has  taken  longer  for  new  women  to 
integrate  into  the  group;  for  part- 
time  women  this  has  been  an  even 
greater  burden,  and  we  are  currently 
reviewing  our  training  system  and 
whether  hiring  new  part-time  women 
makes  sense.  It  is  important  to  us  that 
women  with  differing  lifestyles  and 
priorities  be  members  of  the  collec- 
tive; and  yet  it  places  a  burden  on  the 
collective  and  on  those  individual 
women  to  be  part-time  members. 
Part-time    women    spend    a    greater 

M  word  we  use  to  describe  licensed  medical 
professionals. 


proportion  of  their  time  in  meetings 
and  reading  notes  than  full-time 
women;  because  of  more  flexible 
time,  full-time  women  fill  in  more 
often  during  crises. 

Job  rotation  is  an  important  aspect 
of  our  work,  insuring  that  skills  are 
shared  and  everyone  can  bring  first- 
hand experiences  to  the  decision- 
making process.  Some  tasks,  like 
answering  the  phone,  are  shared  on  a 
daily  basis.  For  continuity's  sake, 
other  jobs,  such  as  sending  out  lab 
results,  are  rotated  on  a  monthly 
basis.  There  are  also  long-range  tasks 
like  bookkeeping  and  committee 
membership,  which  require  a  greater 
time  perspective  and  therefore  are 
changed  every  six  months. 

In  order  to  share  information  fully, 
to  make  decisions  wisely,  and  to 
evaluate  our  process,  we  schedule 
three  collective  meetings  each  week. 
None  of  our  meetings  is  mandatory 
per  se,  although  the  business  meeting 
is  a  collective  priority;  the 
issues/education  forums,  medical 
and  self-help  experience-sharing 
meetings,  and  ongoing  self-help 
groups  have  lesser  priority. 

The  business  meeting  has  a 
carefully  structured  agenda  to 
facilitate  efficiency  while  allowing 
for  lengthy  discussion  on  sensitive 
issues.  Individual  women  and  com- 
mittees present  their  work  during 
this  meeting.  We  make  decisions 
about  the  administrative, 
educational,  and  medical  aspects  of 
the  health  center.  Decisions  are  made 
by  consensus.  The  chairwoman  is 
responsible  for  facilitating  dis- 
cussions and  decision-making.  The 
chair,  potentially  very  powerful,  is 
rotated  each  week  to  share  this  power 
and  to  allow  all  women  to  develop  the 


16/Quest 


skills  needed  for  chairing.  It  is  up  to 
the  chair-woman  to  insure  that 
everyone  has  space  to  disagree,  and 
that  each  woman  verbalizes  her  dis- 
agreement with  an  issue,  although 
there  is  not  always  time  for  women  to 
express  their  thoughts  when  they 
agree.  Any  one  member  can  block 
consensus.  If  there  is  disagreement, 
further  discussion  and  clarification  of 
positions  ensues  until  agreement  can 
be  reached,  or  until  it  becomes  ob- 
vious that  consensus  cannot  be 
reached.  In  this  case  the  issue  is 
"tabled"  and  resubmitted  to  the  in- 
dividual woman  or  committee  for 
further  work. 

We  have  two  mechanisms  for 
streamlining  complex  discussions: 
women  write  proposals  or  ideas  and 
put  them  on  a  "projects  for  com- 
ment" (PC)  wall,  or  put  letters,  ar- 
ticles, etc.  into  a  folder  entitled  "im- 
portant stuff  to  be  read"  (ISTBR).  As 
time  allows,  these  items  are  an- 
nounced in  a  meeting,  women  read 
and  comment  on  the  issues,  and  the 
item  is  discussed  at  the  next  business 
meeting.  The  woman  or  committee 
raising  the  issue  is  responsible  for  in- 
corporating all  the  suggestions  and 
changes  made  by  collective  members 
into  the  proposal,  and  for  organizing 
the  discussion  of  the  item.  Sometimes 
a  project  is  resubmitted  to  ISTBR  or 
to  PC  if  consensus  cannot  be  reached, 
if  serious  objections  are  raised,  or  if 
not  enough  collective  members  have 
read  the  proposal.  This  process  is 
more  or  less  lengthy  according  to 
deadlines,  urgency  of  the  issues,  or 
conflict  among  collective  members. 
Our  business  meetings  have  grown  in 
length  from  three  hours  to  eight 
hours,  and  we  are  consciously  trying 
to   develop   ways   to   maximize   our 


productivity  without  subverting  the 
collective  process.  The  last  ten 
minutes  of  our  business  meetings  are 
reserved  for  criticism  and  self- 
criticism. 


About  every  week  we  meet 
together  to  share  experiences  as 
health  workers  and  as  facilitators  of 
self-help  presentations  and  groups. 
Difficult  questions  or  issues  raised 
during  particular  sessions  are  shared 
at  this  time,  as  are  energizing 
episodes.  This  meeting  alternates 
with  our  ongoing  self-help  groups, 
where  we  share  research  and  skills 
useful  to  us  as  health  workers  (infor- 
mation about  specific  topics  like 
menopause  and  nutrition  or  practical 
skills  such  as  doing  bimanual  exams), 
and  with  educational  and  political 
discussions. 

Energy-Drain  Problems 

One  mechanism  we  developed  for 
dealing  with  the  physical  and  mental 
drain  of  working  at  the  center  has 
been  the  weekend  retreat.  Our  first 
retreat,  solely  for  recreation,  was  held 
almost  two  years  ago  and  served  as 
an  excellent  vehicle  for  women  get- 
ting to  know  each  other  better. 
Currently  our  retreats  are  held  every 
six  months  and  are  structured  to  in- 
clude meeting  time.  During  these 
meetings  we  discuss  issues  which 
have  come  up  during  the  months 
before  the  retreat.  Fun  is  definitely 


Health  Center/17 


included  and  we  share  tasks  such  as 
childcare,  cooking,  and  cleanup. 


At  a  recent  retreat  we  focused  on 
our  working  pace.  Because  of  the 
number  of  hours  each  of  us  spends 
working,  a  "burn-out"  pattern  had 
developed.  Some  women  found  that 
they  needed  to  separate  themselves 
entirely  from  the  collective  in  order  to 
reenergize.  We  analyzed  what  this 
meant  both  for  the  individual  woman 
and  for  the  collective.  Part  of  our 
solution  involved  instituting  leaves 
of  absence  (LOA's),  which  are 
extended  time  periods  during  which 
women  do  not  work  at  the  center. 
Each  woman  is  paid  a  half-time 
salary  during  her  LOA  so  that  all 
women  can  afford  to  take  leaves.  Our 
guideline  is  that  a  woman  may  take  a 
LOA  of  1-2  months  after  working  in 
the  collective  for  a  year  and  a  half. 
The  collective  has  set  up  a 
mechanism  which  should  allow 
maintenance  work  to  continue  un- 
hampered. 

Instituting  LOA's  has  been  an  im- 
portant step  in  our  collective  recogni- 
tion that  we  all  need  time  and  space 
for  ourselves  and  that  we  also  need  to 
take  collective  responsibility  for  our 
time  and  energy.  We  need  strong, 
healthy,  decently  paid  women  to 
create  strong,  viable  feminist  in- 
stitutions. Before  LOA's  were  in- 
stituted, crisis  situations  developed  as 
women  left  when  they  were  burned- 


out.  The  rest  of  the  collective  would 
then  extend  ourselves  and  overwork 
even  more,  leading  to  more  burn- 
outs. We  are  acting  to  prevent  this 
common  situation  from  becoming 
overtly  institutionalized. 

Implementing  LOA's  has  not 
solved  our  problem  of  daily 
overwork.  However,  combining 
LOA's,  explicit  job  rotation,  two- 
week  paid  vacations  per  year,  and  ten 
personal  leave  days  each  year,  has 
contributed  significantly  to  keeping 
ourselves  and  our  work  more  sane 
and  healthy.  We  still  have  a  long  way 
to  go. 

Ideally,  we  would  like  most  women 
to  be  able  to  work  at  the  health  center 
for  several  years  without  the  high 
burn-out  and  turn-over  rate  from 
which    we    are   currently   suffering. 


Inadequate  salaries  force  many  of  us 
to  work  in  other  jobs  as  well,  and 
several  women  who  want  to  work 
full-time  have  found  themselves  un- 
able to  do  so.  Unwilling  to  stop 
expanding  our  programs  and  political 
actions,  we  have  increased  collective 
size  so  that  we  can  maintain  the 
health  center  as  well.  In  fact,  we  have 
just  about  outgrown  our  building** 


18  /Quest 


and  some  of  our  current  structures 
for  equal  sharing  of  jobs,  informa- 
tion, and  decision-making. 

Incorporating  new  women  into  the 
group  requires  a  lot  of  time  and 
energy.  Two  years  ago,  after  the  first 
several  months  of  operating  the 
health  center,  we  closed  the  collective 
so  that  we  could  adjust  to  working 
together  and  focus  as  a  group  on  our 
work  processes.  No  structure  had 
been  set  up  to  train  new  members  and 
organizational  structures  generally 
were  still  relatively  undeveloped. 
After  being  closed  for  almost  a  year, 
we  admitted  new  members  as  some 
women  left,  and  developed  a  process 
for  training  and  integrating  these 
women  into  the  group.  Each  new 
member  has  two  full-time  women  act 
as  her  advocates.  Through  experience 
we  found  that  part-time  advocates 
cannot  provide  smooth,  non- 
fragmented  entry  into  the  collective. 
Advocates  meet  with  a  new  member 
to  devise  a  realistic  plan  for  learning 
various  tasks,  and  acquaint  her  with 
overall  collective  workings.  The  ad- 
vocates are  responsible  for  deciding, 
with  the  new  member,  when  they  are 
mutually  confident  about  her  skills. 
In  the  training  process,  a  woman  first 
observes  various  tasks;  later  she  co- 
works  with  another  member  of  the 
collective.  Finally,  when  she  feels 
knowledgeable  and  comfortable  with 
the  task,  she  is  observed  and 
evaluated. 

A  six-week  evaluation  meeting  is 
planned  which  gives  new  members 
an  opportunity  to  discuss  their  in- 
tegration into  the  collective  in  a  spirit 

**For  two  years  we  have  been  in  the  process 
of  becoming  licensed  as  a  clinic.  Changing  our 
location  would  necessitate  beginning  this

of  criticism  and  self-criticism.  This 
has  proved  to  be  a  useful  tool  on  both 
a  working  level  and  a  political  level 
since  new  members  have  an  oppor- 
tunity to  address  political  issues  and 
to  discuss  their  development  and 
goals.  The  division  between  old  and 
new  members  has  been  difficult  in 
the  past.  While  recognizing  those 
with  more  experience  and 
acknowledging  their  skills,  we  have 
sought    to    share    their   experiences.

Often  this  has  meant  that  a  "skilled" 
person  will  accompany  a  "not-so- 
skilled"  person  on  a  self-help  presen- 
tation, to  an  interview,  and  so  on. 
This  is  one  reason  why  we  have  a 
policy  that  two  women  always  travel 
to  conferences,  do  presentations  and 
give  interviews  together.  It  gives  us 
perspective  and  support  and  allows 
for  sharing  skills  and  power. 

Childcare  is  another  need  we  have 
had  to  address  in  the  course  of  the 
last  three  years.  At  first,  none  of  the 
women  in  the  group  had  children.  As 
we  grew,  it  became  imperative  that 
we  devise  mutually  acceptable, 
creative  ways  of  dealing  with 
children.  When  the  first  woman  with 
a  small  child  joined  the  group,  each 
member  of  the  collective  was 
expected  to  spend  Vi  day  each  week 
taking  care  of  her.  As  other  mothers 


Health  Center/19 


became  part  of  the  collective,  this 
became  more  difficult.  It  meant  that 
each  child  had  to  know  and  relate  to 
twenty-one  women  and  that  each  of 
us  needed  to  be  aware  of  each  child's 
development.  Furthermore,  this 
structure  was  not  adequate  for  older 
children. 

We  resolved  the  situation  by  form- 
ing a  small  group  in  the  collective 
which  takes  responsibility  for  the 
children  while  their  mothers  are  at 
work.  Each  of  the  older  children  has 
her  or  his  own  advocate  to  whom 
she/he  looks  for  information  about 
the  collective  and  communicates 
her/his  interests  and  needs.  Childcare 
requires  commitment  by  mothers  to 
share  child-raising  and  by  others  of 
us  to  take  active  responsibility  for  the 
children.  Most  of  the  childcare  is 
done  at  the  center  itself,  which  af- 
fords the  mothers  and  children  time 
together    when    thev    so    choose. 


Women  who  have  childcare  respon- 
sibilities are  relieved  from  other  tasks 
by  women  who  do  not  share  child- 
care. Meetings  of  the  childcare  com- 
mittee are  held  as  time  and  needs  dic- 


tate. 


There  are  still  outstanding 
problems  we  face  in  our  work.  One 
of  the  foremost  is  money.  Although 
we  have  come  a  long  way  from  a 


group  that  met  once  per  week  with 
no  paid  members  to  a  working  collec- 
tive with  every  full-and  part-time 
member  receiving  a  weekly  salary,  we 
still  have  a  long  way  to  go.  Our  deci- 
sion to  pay  salaries  was  the  outcome 
of  our  political  commitment  to  sup- 
port women  for  our  work  and  the 
necessity  for  continuity  in  staffing 
and  expanding  our  programs.  Money 
for  salaries  and  expenses  is  raised 
from  donations,  from  fees  for 
medical  services  and  from  honoraria 
for  self-help  presentations  and 
groups.  A  few  small  grants  have  been 
received  from  local  foundations,  but 
we  have  decided  to  remain  dependent 
on  ourselves  by  generating  projects 
for  our  income,  rather  than  on 
private  or  governmental  agencies. 
Unfortunately,  it  is  health  care,  not 
politics,  that  generates  money.  In 
spite  of  this  fact,  we  continue  to  be 
strongly  committed  to  all  aspects  of 
the  women's  health  movement,  par- 
ticularly politicking. 

A  full-time  salary  is  $85/week, 
part-time  is  $42.50.  Some  women  are 
paid  more  than  these  amounts  ac- 
cording to  need:  each  of  us  evaluated 
our  financial  situations,  and  the 
financial  evaluation  committee  then 
recommended  salaries.  The  collective 
accepted  these  recommendations  in  a 
business  meeting.  A  continuing  goal 
is  to  pay  ourselves  a  decent  salary. 

We  work  under  constant  financial 
instability,  which  means  decisions  are 
affected  by  severe  financial  con- 
straints. Although  financial  instabili- 
ty is  common  for  business  ventures 
that  are  only  a  few  years  old,  this 
does  serve  to  devitalize  us  both  per- 
sonally and  collectively.  Each  week 
some  women  have  to  take  IOU's 
because  of  lack  of  money.  Burn-out 


20  /Quest 


and  low  energy  levels  seem  directly 
related  to  economic  insecurity  and, 
hence,  our  financial  situation  must  be 
resolved. 


Furthermore,  our  collective  pover- 
ty has  determined  which  individual 
women  can  afford  to  join  the  group. 
We  are  mostly  white,  middle  and  up- 
per middle-class  women;  many  of  us 
still  have  to  depend  on  outside 
sources  of  money  such  as  other  part- 
time  jobs,  savings,  and  support  from 
other  household  members,  husbands 
or  lovers.  This  is  an  untenable  situa- 
tion. Through  the  analysis  of  a  new 
financial  evaluation  committee,  we 
have  found  that  it  is  not  sufficient  for 
us  to  be  conscious  of  short-range 
economics;  we  must  have  a  projected 
annual  overview.  We  have  tried 
various  committee  structures  in  order 
to  provide  both  overview  and 
maintenance-money  consciousness. 
Our  present  structure  includes  both  a 
financial  evaluation  committee  and  a 
separate  bookkeeping  committee. 
The  pressures  and  frustrations  of  our 
financial  situation  drain  a  tremen- 
dous amount  of  energy,  limit  our 
effectiveness,  and  threaten  our  con- 
tinuing existence. 


Although  problems  are  inherent  in 
our  political  work,  we  are  optimistic 
about  the  process  we  have  begun  in 
struggling  for  collective  survival.  We 
try  to  deal  with  personal  as  well  as 
political  issues  in  a  constructive 
manner  while  keeping  in  mind  our 
visions  for  the  future.  Feminist 
models  of  organizing  work  are  being 
devised  for  the  first  time  in  many 
areas  and  we  are  excited  that  we  are 
part  of  this  political  consciousness. 

We  request  and  welcome  feedback, 
suggestions  or  questions  posed  by 
this  article.  It  has  been  written  as  part 
of  our  collective  commitment  to  self- 
help  and  will  be  most  successful  if  it 
generates  dialogue  in  the  feminist 
community  on  the  issues  of  process 
and  organization.  We  would  like  to 
become  part  of  such  ongoing  dis- 
cussions so  that  we  may  continue  to 
grow  both  as  a  feminist  institution 
and  as  individual  women  who  com- 
prise that  institution.

This  article  was  written  over  one 
year  ago.  Since  that  time  the  Center 
has  changed  structure  and  has  been 
evaluating  its  overall  programs  and 
politics.  This  article  does  not  ac-

although  it  is  a  valid  historical  docu-

Self-  Containment 


By  ALESIA  KUNZ 

The  ways  in  which  feminists 
choose  to  show  ourselves  is  of  no 
small  importance.  It  often  happens 
that  if  we  act  in  a  certain  manner,  we 
are  treated  accordingly.  For  instance, 
in  a  women's  studies  group  I  was  a 
member  of  for  five  years,  we  decided 
that  in  dealing  with  the  administra- 
tion of  the  university  we  would  never 
ask  them  for  anything.  Rather,  we 
would  demand  it  as  our  need  and 
right.  We  always  told  them  where 
our  meetings  with  them  would  take 
place.  We  chose  to  assume  the 
posture  of  power  in  every  way  we 
could.  We  knew,  however,  that  in 
some  real  sense  we  had  no  power.  We 
existed  at  their  whim. 

At  the  beginning,  we  had  neither 
money  nor  any  known  committed 
constituency.  But  assuming  the  role 
of  power  had  two  major  effects.  First, 
the  administration  began  treating  us 
more  as  if  we  were  in  fact  powerful. 
They  began  acting  more  respectfully 
towards  us;  they  continued  to  meet 
our  increasing  financial  demands; 
and  they  conceded  our  autonomy 
over  the  women's  studies  program. 
The  second  major  effect  of  our  acting 

This  is  a  shortened  version  of  an  un- 
published manuscript. 


powerful  was  that  we  began  to  feel 
powerful.  I  don't  mean  to  sound  as  if 
this  is  a  simple  linear  process,  or  as  if 
it  always  works.  It  is  a  complex, 
simultaneous  and  multi-dimensional 
process  which  may  have  profitable 
effects  for  a  time,  as  it  did  with  us.  It 
is  risky.  You  need  to  act. 

What  I'm  trying  to  do  is  build  a 
case  for  the  importance  of  style.  The 
way  in  which  we  choose  to  move  is 
an  integral  part  of  the  move  and  the 
desired  outcome.  I  think  it's  time  for 
us  to  make  some  new  moves. 

In  the  past  several  years  the 
women's  movement  has  slowed 
down.  At  least  part  of  the  reason  we 
are  not  moving  is  that  we  are  relying 
on  a  style  of  behavior  which  is  no 
longer  appropriate.  Most  of  us  have 
followed  these  patterns  successfully 
and  continue  to  do  so,  regardless  of 
whether  or  not  they  help  us  to  ad- 
vance. I  call  this  style  a  combination 
of  blatancy  (a  head-on  approach)  and 
self -containment.  The  blatancy  com- 
ponent of  our  style  is  illustrated  by  a 
group  (or  individual)  stating  who 
they  are  and  what  their  perceived 
function  is:  "We  are  a  feminist 
newspaper;  we  report  stories  of  in- 
terest to  the  feminist  population;  we 
analyze  world  events  from  a  feminist

perspective."  The  directness  of  this 
method  is  obvious.  We  say  what  we 
mean  and  mean  what  we  say.  We 
state  who  we  are,  and  what  our  goals 
are,  openly,  blatantly.  This  is  a  help- 
ful way  not  to  lose  sight  of  who  we 
are  and  what  we  want;  it  can  help 
solidify  our  ideas,  our  goals,  and  our 
identities.  It  can  be  a  good  defense 
against  cooptation  because  we  and 
everyone  else  knows  exactly  what  we 
are  about.  We  have  learned  to  use 
this  part  of  the  style  effectively. 

The  second  component  of  this 
style  is  self-containment.  Self- 
containment  is  a  tendency  to  keep  the 
group's  sphere  of  activity  within  the 
movement.  I  don't  mean  that  we're 
not  interested  in  contacting  women 
who  are  not  part  of  the  movement 
already.  I  mean  that  we  do  not  try  to 
project  ourselves  out  too  far  into  the 
culture-at-large.  We  project  out  only 
to  the  extent  that  we  declare  openly 
who  we  are.  For  instance,  "We  have  a 
feminist  newspaper  which  is  self- 
supporting  and  has  a  readership  of 
5,000  women."  This  paper  exists 
within  the  same  society  as  the 
Military  Industrial  Complex  (MIC) 
newspaper.  But  while  we  put 
ourselves  out  into  this  larger  culture 
to  some  degree,  we  see  ourselves,  the 
feminist  newspaper,  as  existing  quite 
apart  from  the  MIC  newspaper.  We 
see  our  paper  being  consumed  by  a 
different  culture  than  the  one  that 
consumes  the  MIC  paper:  most  of 
the  MIC  press  consumers  do  not  buy 
our  feminist  paper.  But  do  the  people 
who  read  ours  also  read  theirs? 

The  important  point  is  that  we 
view  ourselves  as  very  separate  from 
the  culture-at-large  represented  by 
the  MIC  press.  For  the  most  part,  we 
appear  to  be  content  with  this  and 


seem  to  want  to  continue  this  way.  It 
is  safer,  more  supportive,  healthier, 
more  radical  and  it  feels  better.  This 
would  be  all  right  except  that  we  have 
this  huge,  threatening  culture-at- 
large  breathing  down  our  backs. 

Self-containment  has  allowed  us 
space  and  a  supportive  environment 
in  which  to  learn  politics,  trust,  work, 
skills,  collectivity,  leadership, 
responsibility,  and  accountability. 
We  have  had  to  live  and  work  with 
ourselves  in  order  to  build  and  gain 
strength  and  a  sense  of  our  power 
and  potential.  We  have  developed 
structures  and  politics,  and  we  are 
functioning,  in  a  circumscribed 
sense,  successfully.  We  have  begun 
to  develop  ourselves  as  a  culture. 

But  ultimately,  where  can  we  go 
with  self-containment?  Nowhere.  We 
have  created  a  small  culture,  a  tiny, 
supportive  world,  yet  most  of  us  find 
it  necessary  to  walk  with  a  foot  in 
each  world.  I  do  not  want  us  to  re- 
main self-contained  and  constantly 
defending  against  the  culture-at- 
large.  I  do  not  want  us  to  remain 
relatively  powerless  in  relationship  to 
the  rest  of  the  world.  My  desire  is 
that  we  become  the  culture-at-large. 
We  are  in  the  process,  but  we  have 
hit  a  snag.  Self -containment,  in  the 
sense  of  remaining  apart  from  the 
patriarchal  culture  and  its  influences, 
has  outlived  its  purposes. 

We  have  been  standing  still  for 
some  time  now  because  we  are  not 
sure  we  want  to  do  whatever  is 
necessary  to  become  the  culture-at- 
large.  It  may  mean  giving  up  our  self- 
containment  principle,  which  has 
created  a  comfortable  place  for  us.  I 
think  this  is  precisely  our  fate.  We 
have  gained  experience  and  skills  in 
dealing   with   power,   in   controlling 


From  Self-Containment  to  Insidiousness/23 


finances,  in  making  policy  decisions, 
mostly  on  a  small  scale.  It  is  time  for 
us  to  use  our  experience  and  our 
skills  to  direct  and  influence  the 
culture  in  a  more  calculated  way— a 
way  in  which  we  ultimately  become 
the  culture. 

One  way  we  can  become  the 
culture  is  to  interact  in  a  calculated 
way.  I  suggest  we  drop  our  concen- 
tration on  self-containment  and 
replace  it  with  insidiousness.  I  use  the 
term  "insidiousness"  in  its  most 
honorable  sense  to  mean  constantly 
insinuating  new  ideas  into  old 
frameworks  with  the  goal  of  creating 
new  ways  of  perceiving  and  acting. 
Insidiousness  is  constantly  creeping, 
undaunted.  Insidiousness  is  treach- 
erous to  the  MIC;  it  means  constant- 
ly interacting  and  moving.  We  need 
this.  I  do  not  mean  going  Avon, 
although  that  might  be  a  fascinating 
manoeuver.  I  mean  that  we  need  to 
interact  with  the  culture  in  a  more 
calculated-  toward-  many-  specific-  ends 
manner.  Our  head-on,  self-contained 
style  has  been  a  viable  way  of 
grappling  with  issues,  and  in  some 
specific  cases,  may  still  be  useful;  but 
we  need  to  entertain  other  ways  to 
advance. 


Interacting  with  the  culture-at- 
large  is  a  risk.  We  need  to  calculate. 
We  need  to  figure  out  what  it  is  we 
want  to  accomplish  by  a  particular 
interaction,  and  then  organize  to  do  it. 
For  instance,  in  establishing  a  shelter 
for  battered  women,  we  may  osten- 
sibly focus  on  publicizing  the  in- 
justice, the  inhumanity  of  woman- 
beating,  with  our  apparent  goals 
being  to  stop  the  practice,  change 
laws,  and  arouse  public  sentiment  in 


order  to  get  more  money.  Our  un- 
stated but  calculated  goals,  however, 
may  be  to  build  a  new  consciousness 
of  self  and  power  within  women,  to 
teach  us  new  skills  so  we  can  live 
financilly  and  psychologically  in- 
dependent lives,  and  to  remove 
males'  life  support  systems.  It's  a 
matter  of  projecting  a  certain  visible 
message  while  infiltrating  with  the 
other,  initially  unrecognizable 
messages,  but  messages  we  are  very 
clear  about. 

In  the  process  of  getting  power,  of 
becoming  the  culture/world,  we  need 
to  achieve  a  difficult  balance  between 
being  co-opted  and  ultimately  effec- 
ting huge  change.  We  cannot  be  sure 
it  will  work.  But  since  those  with 
power  never  give  it  up  voluntarily,  it 
doesn't  seem  to  be  a  good  idea  to  tell 
the  enemy  we're  going  to  lead  with 
the  right*  unless  our  fatal  blow  is  the 
follow-up  with  the  left  foot.  This  is 
the  most  basic  level  on  which  we 
need  to  adopt  insidiousness  as  a 
major  component  of  our  style. 

As  we  replace  self-containment 
with  insidiousness,  blatancy  becomes 
a  new  creature.  Blatancy  now 
becomes  part  of  the  calculation  so 
that  we  attack  on  more  than  one  front 
simultaneously  in  order  to  ac- 
complish various  goals.  It  becomes 
part  of  the  whole  manoeuver  which  is 
accomplished  through  careful  coor- 
dination. One  major  difference 
between  the  old  blatancy  (coupled 
with  self-containment)  and  the  new 
blatancy  (coupled  with  insidiousness) 
is  expectancy.  Before,  we  stated  our 
purposes  and  goals  for  everyone  to 
see,  and  they  were  exactly  what  we 
expected.  In  the  new  blatancy,  we 
state  openly  only  those  purposes  and 
goals  we  want  the  culture-at-large  to 


24/Quesf 


see.  Our  other  purposes  and  goals  we 
do  not  make  public.  But  we  expect  to 
accomplish  them  all— we  plan  on  it, 
calculate  it,  work  toward  it,  envision 
it,  feel  it,  think  it,  expect  it.  Expectan- 
cy has  great  power  and  we  need  to 
explore  and  use  it. 


Although  it  may  be  frightening  at 
first  to  think  of  using  insidiousness, 
it  may  be  less  so  when  we  actually  do 
it.  In  fact,  many  of  us  have  been 
applying  it  to  some  degree  in  a  more 
personal  sense  for  some  time.  From 
the  outset  in  the  women's  movement 
we  have  started  with  the  personal  and 
moved  to  the  political.  Just  in  this 
way  there  is  a  principle  at  the  root  of 
insidiousness  which  each  of  us  can 
personalize  before  projecting  out. 
This  principle  is  self-education.  Self- 
education    means    committing 


ourselves  to  a  process.  It  means,  "I 
can  never  stop;  I  must  always  make 
up  my  own  questions."  It  means 
committing  myself  to  my  self,  to 
ourselves,  to  direct  our  own  learning. 
When  we  are  ready  to  take  this 
process  out,  organize  it,  and  calculate 
with  it,  we  move  into  insidiousness. 
Then  we  must  live  dangerously  and 
wisely— project  ourselves  out 
together  and  be  insidious.  Self -educa- 
tion connotes  the  power  and  threat  of 
women  taking  ultimate  control  over 
and  responsibility  for  our  own  lives, 
thereby  creating  a  new  world, 
becoming  the  culture.

Organizers'  Dialogue 


Editors'  Introduction  — 
The  following  article  by  Christine 
Pattee  and  comment  by  Beverly  Stone 
are  part  of  our  new  section  which  will 
contain  discussions  of  organizing 
experiences  in  the  feminist  communi- 
ty. Pattee 's  article  defines  one  of  the 
principal  problems  of  the  New 
Haven  Feminist  Federal  Credit  Union 
as  having  been  its  inadequacy  in 
developing  "good  business  practices" 
as  opposed  to  feminist  politics.  We 
believe  this  is  one  of  the  questions 
facing  all  feminist  credit  unions 
[FCU's].  As  part  of  this  section,  we 
are  soliciting  short  responses  from  all 
of  the  FCU's  about  their  credit  union 
and  how  each  balances  politics  with 
business.  We  hope  to  address 
questions  such  as  what  is  good 
business  and  management?  Are  they 
incompatible  with  feminist  politics, 
and  if  so,  how?  Must  business  take 
precedence  over  political  convictions? 
How  does  an  FCU  develop  loan 
policies  and  guidelines  with  business 
and/or  politics  in  mind?  What  about 
the  questions  NHFFCU's  experience 
raises  about  black  and  white  women 
working  together?  What  is  the 
experience  of  other  credit  unions? 

These  questions  are  only  intended 
to  provoke  your  thinking.  We  are 
looking  for  the  kind  of  dialogue  that 
will  provide  some  guidance  for  the 


many  feminist  organizers  still 
struggling  in  feminist  credit  unions. 
Future  responses  will  appear  in  this 
section,  and  we  encourage  you  to  ad- 
dress articles  and  letters  to  the 
"Organizers'  Dialogue." 

Death  of  a  Dream: 

Failure  of  a  Feminist  Credit  Union 

By  CHRISTINE  PATTEE

Money  is  power,  and  by  the  early 
seventies,  the  women's  movement 
was  ready  to  take  some  of  that  power. 
Through  feminist  credit  unions,  we 
feminists  were  going  to  put  our 
money  to  work  for  ourselves.  The 
opportunity  to  gain  control  over  our 
own  economic  lives  was  so  enticing 
that  feminists  all  over  the  country 
opened  credit  unions,  often  without 
taking  time  to  explore  the  personal, 
political  and  practical  ramifications 
of  such  a  venture.  Starting  with 
Detroit's  First  Feminist  Credit  Union 
in  1973,  eighteen  feminist  credit  un- 
ions had  received  federal  charters  by 
the  end  of  1976.  In  November  of  that 
year,  the  number  was  reduced  by  one

Organizers'  Dialogue 


when  the  Connecticut  Feminist 
Federal  Credit  Union  (CFFCU) 
closed.  It  had  opened  amidst  great 
dreams  of  making  money  accessible 
to  all  women,  but  now  those  dreams 
have  shattered  along  with  broken 
friendships,  unresolved  racial  con- 
flicts and  two  and  a  half  years  of  the 
lives  of  women  who  tried  and  failed 
to  make  their  feminist  visions  into 
reality. 

The  specific  event  which 
precipitated  liquidation  was  the 
appearance  of  a  new,  particularly 
strict  federal  auditor  who  found  a 
high  delinquency  rate  and  generally 
unstable  financial  conditions.  He 
gave  CFFCU  three  alternatives:  (1)  to 
merge  with  another  feminist  credit 
union,  which  turned  out  to  be  un- 
workable financially  and 
organizationally;  (2)  to  get  grant 
money  to  cover  operating  expenses, 
something  they  had  already  tried 
without  success;  or  (3)  to  liquidate. 
They  really  had  no  options  and  chose 
to  close  voluntarily.  Painful  as  the 
experience  may  be,  feminists  need  to 
look  at  an  alternative  institution  that 
didn't  succeed. 

The  women  of  CFFCU  failed 
because  they  couldn't  make  hard- 
headed  business  decisions  in  the  face 
of  a  poor  woman's  need  for  money. 
They  failed  because  they  neither  un- 
derstood nor  accepted  the  written  and 


unwritten  rules  which  restrict  all 
financial  institutions.  They  failed 
because  they  couldn't  resolve  con- 
flicts between  black  and  white 
women  working  in  the  organization. 
And  they  failed  because  they 
couldn't  combine  their  feminist 
visions  of  Utopia  with  the  skills 
necessary  to  keep  a  business  going. 

CFFCU  started  with  great 
enthusiasm  in  the  spring  of  1974, 
when  two  members  of  New  Haven 
Women's  Liberation  visited  Detroit's 
feminist  credit  union.  They  came 
back  excited  about  a  great, 
cooperative  way  to  recycle  money  for 
women.  A  credit  union,  the\ 
explained,  is  a  savings  and  loan 
cooperative  composed  of  people  with 
a  common  bond  —  in  this  case  the 
women's  movement.  Members 
deposit  savings,  or  shares  which  can 
draw  up  to  six  percent  interest,  and 
member/borrowers  take  out  loans 
repayable  at  no  more  than  twelve 
percent.  The  credit  union  operates  on 
the  difference  between  the  12%  com- 
ing in  from  borrowers  and  the  6% 
going  out  to  savers.  Best  of  all,  the 
operation  is  insured  by  the  federal 
government,  so  all  of  our  savings  are 
protected  as  we  set  about  using  our 
money  to  make  more  money  for 
women. 

CFFCU  membership  was  drawn 
from  four  groups:   the  New  Haven 


Organizers'  Dialogue/27 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


Women's  Liberation  Center,  the 
National  Organization  for  Women, 
the  Connecticut  Women's  Political 
Caucus  and  Black  Women  United  in 
Struggle/(BWUIS).  On  August  26, 
1974,  they  opened  with  a  dramatic 
ceremony  in  which  a  woman  cut  a 
chain  symbolizing  the  breaking  of 
women's   economic  bondage. 

Their  first  newsletter  announced 
the  foundation  of  CFFCU:  "It  is  im- 
perative that  non-traditional  sources 
[of  money]  be  explored  to  insure 
maximum  freedom  from  outside  con- 
straints, to  increase  women's  control 
and  competence  over  money,  and  to 
recycle  money  within  the  movement. 
.  .  .  Once  the  credit  union  is  fully  es- 
tablished, it  could  well  expand  itself 
as  a  financial  resource  center."1  .  .  . 
This  was  a  wonderful  vision  of  the 
future,  but  not  a  very  useful  guide  to 
practice.  The  failure  to  clearly  specify 
practical  procedures  as  well  as 
political  goals  was  the  most  serious 
problem  of  the  credit  union. 

The  need  for  specific  procedural 
guidelines  first  became  evident  with 
the  appearance  of  delinquent  loans. 
The  credit  union  founders  had  really 
believed  that  the  common  bond  of 
shared  discrimination  would  assure 
the  commitment  of  individual  women 
to  repayment  of  loans.  Their  first 
brochure  states,  "Existing  credit  un- 
ions prove  what  we  have  long  felt: 


Women  are  usually  reliable  when  it 
comes  to  paying  back  money  they 
have  borrowed." 

When  the  inevitable  happened  and 
some  women  did  not  repay,  the  credit 
union  women  were  not  prepared  to 
respond  to  the  problem.  It  was  one 
thing  to  talk  about  loaning  money  to 
women  from  whom  banks  were 
foolishly  withholding  credit  just 
because  they  were  female.  It  was 
quite  another  thing  to  sit  face  to  face 
with  a  woman  who  clearly  needed 
cash  but  couldn't  afford  to  pay  back 
a  loan. 

Awareness  of  delinquencies  and 
their  effect  on  the  already  tenuous 
financial  position  of  the  credit  union 
dawned  on  staffers  first.  They  began 
to  press  the  board  to  provide  specific 
guidelines  for  determining  the  credit 
worthiness  of  individuals.  CFFCU's 
first  descriptive  brochure  had  laid  out 
some  very  general  principles:  "In 
borrowing  you  will  not  be  dis- 
criminated against  if  you  need  less 
than  $500,  the  usual  bank  minimum; 
you  are  single  or  married,  separated, 
divorced  or  widowed;  your  income  is 
from  alimony  or  social  security;  you 
need  money  for  legal  expenses, 
pregnancy  or  abortion;  you  have 
never  borrowed  money  before;  your 
spouse  has  or  had  a  bad  credit  rating; 
you  can't  get  credit  anywhere  else. 
What  will  count  is  your  ability  and 


28/Quest 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


willingness  to  repay  and  what  your 
friends  and  relatives  say  about  your 
reliability."2  This  outline  was  not 
very  useful  since  the  emphasis  was 
on  who  would  get  money,  not  who 
should  be  denied  it. 

Some  of  the  failure  to  generate 
specific  policy  was  because  most  of 
the  women  of  CFFCU  knew  nothing 
about  financial  institutions,  so  they 
had  to  learn  on  the  job.  Board,  credit 
committee  and  staff  were  making 
policy  decisions  at  the  same  time  they 
were  learning  bookkeeping,  credit 
checks  and  computer  processing,  and 
while  they  were  working  in  a  collec- 
tive, non-hierarchical  manner.  Un- 
fortunately, the  collective  process  is 
inefficient  for  the  kind  of  exacting, 
detailed  bookwork  found  in  a  credit 
union.  It  is  also  liable  to  break  down 
in  the  face  of  disagreements,  unless  it 
also  provides  some  structure  to  force 
resolution  of  conflict. 

The  Complexities  of  Racism 

About  six  months  after  opening, 
CFFCU  had  held  its  first  elections.  A 
credit  committee  of  three  white  and 
three  black  women  was  elected.  Some 
assumed  rather  optimistically  that  a 
situation  had  been  created  in  which 
black  and  white  women  could  for 
once  work  together  as  equals,  with  no 
tokenism    and    at    a    task    offering 


benefits  to  both  groups.  How  wrong 
they  were!  Economic  and  class  issues 
are  so  thoroughly  tangled  up  with 
racial  issues  that  a  task  like  distribu- 
tion of  money  cut  to  the  very  bone  of 
the  most  divisive  issues  in  the  move- 
ment. 

Things  went  from  bad  to  worse  as 
the  credit  committee  struggled  to 
make  decisions  on  individual  loan 
applications  without  any  criteria  for 
what  constituted  a  good  loan  risk. 
Some  white  women  charged  that 
black  applicants  were  being  given 
loans  solely  on  the  basis  of  need, 
without  adequate  concern  for  ability 
to  repay.  Some  black  women  accused 
white  staff  and  credit  committee 
members  of  being  racists.  In  dealing 
with  individual  applications,  there 
were  differences  over  an  applicant's 
motives  for  requesting  the  loan  — 
should  a  middle-class  women  get  a 
loan  for  the  "frivolous"  purpose  of 
buying  recreational  equipment?  And 
on  her  credit  worthiness  —  should  a 
black  woman  be  given  eighteen 
months  to  repay  a  $100  rent  security 
loan?  Black  credit  committee 
members  generally  argued  for  longer 
repayment  periods,  less  stringent 
collateral  requirements  and  other 
methods  to  ease  loan  eligibility. 

Into  this  powder-keg  came  staff 
warnings  that  loan  approvals  would 
have  to  be  tightened  because  of  the 


Organizers'  Dialogue/29 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


rapidly  increasing  delinquency  rate, 
4%  -  5%  about  ten  months  after 
opening,  compared  with  a  national 
average  of  3%.  They  asked  the  board 
to  specify  certain  minimum  stan- 
dards based  on  source  and  amount  of 
income,  previous  credit  history, 
living  expenses,  and  other  such 
quantifiable  criteria. 

The  board  did  not  respond  to 
repeated  requests  for  loan  guidelines. 
In  the  first  place,  such  guidelines  are 
not  easy  to  produce.  There  are  some 
generally  accepted  principles  but  no 
clear-cut  formulae  for  the  determina- 
tion of  good  and  bad  loan  risks. 
Secondly,  the  very  real  practical 
problem  was  exacerbated  by  the  in- 
creasingly tense  atmosphere  of  racial 
and  personal  conflict,  whipped  up  in 
part  by  two  of  the  credit  committee 
members,  one  white  and  one  black, 
who  had  brought  with  them  a  history 
of  personal  antagonism.  It  is  impossi- 
ble now,  though,  to  sort  out  the  per- 
sonally crazy  behavior  and  guilt- 
tripping  of  some  individuals,  both 
black  and  white,  from  the  racist 
behavior  patterns  which  whites 
are  likely  to  display,  however  un- 
consciously, towards  blacks.  Within 
three  months  of  the  elections,  by  Ju- 
ly, 1975,  the  situation  had 
deteriorated  so  badly  that  CFFCU 
was  virtually  paralyzed.  Staff  finally 
went  to  the  board  and  demanded  that 


they  resolve  the  conflict. 

Two  feminist  arbitrators  were 
hired,  one  black  and  one  white,  who 
had  experience  in  other  feminist 
credit  unions.  They  interviewed  all 
the  CFFCU  women  involved  and 
carefully  examined  specific  disputed 
loan  applications.  Their  findings 
were  described  in  a  report  written  by 
a  specially  appointed  coordinating 
committee  of  the  board:  "The  ar- 
bitrators pulled  no  punches.  They 
absolved  the  staff  of  racism,  and 
criticized  the  board  for  abdicating 
their  responsibility  to  set  policy. 
They  felt  there  had  not  been  suf- 
ficient discussion  about  goals  and 
objectives,  and  that  therefore,  there 
was  no  cohesiveness." 

"The  arbitrators  made  three 
specific  recommendations:  1)  That 
the  credit  committee  as  it  was 
presently  constituted  be  dissolved 
and  that  the  two  members  of  the  credit 
committee  who  were  not  involved  in 
any  of  the  personal  disputes  [one 
white  and  one  black]  act  as  an  interim 
credit  committee  until  a  new  one 
could  be  formed.  2)  That  a  black 
staffer  be  hired.  3)  That  the  board 
apologize  to  the  staff.  The  [ar- 
bitration] was  not  productive  in  that 
those  involved  continued  to  cling  to 
their  positions,  turning  to  [the  ar- 
bitrators] for  support  rather  than 
talking  to  each  other.  At  the  end  of 


30/Quest 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


the  meeting,  [one  staffer]  resigned 
publicly.  [The  other]  resigned  to  one 
of  the  board  members  a  short  time 
later."3 

Practically  and  emotionally,  this 
upheaval  was  a  blow  from  which 
CFFCU  never  really  recovered.  It 
drained  everybody  of  the  energy  and 
enthusiasm  which  were  so  often  sub- 
stituted for  material  resources.  On 
the  practical  side,  the  two  women 
who  had  the  most  technical  skills  and 
knowledge  were  gone,  as  were  two 
black  women  who  had  been  active  in 
delinquency  control  and  education. 
The  board  members,  who  for  several 
months  afterwards  operated  the 
credit  union  on  a  volunteer  basis, 
probably  did  more  harm  than  good  as 
they  tried  to  handle  the  bookwork. 
And  also  during  that  time,  there  was 
an  abrupt  drop  in  loans,  which  meant 
an  additonal  loss  of  interest  income.4 

CFFCU  had  failed  to  resolve  a 
crucial  dilemma  facing  all 
predominantly  white  liberal  and 
radical  groups.  Having  made  a  real 
effort  to  include  black  women  in 
decision-making  positions,  the  white 
CFFCU  women  were  not  able  to 
work  with  them.  White  liberals/ 
radicals  are  so  hyper-conscious  of 
racism  and  the  possibility  of  their 
own  racist  behavior  that  it  is  nearly 
impossible  for  them  to  interact 
naturally  with  a  black  person  in  a 


working  situation.  Black  women 
probably  find  it  just  as  difficult  to  act 
naturally  in  a  predominantly  white 
organization.  White  women, 
knowing  that  economic  discrimina- 
tion hits  black  women  hardest,  found 
it  difficult  to  spell  out  limits  on  their 
tiny  pot  of  resources.  They  also  were 
afraid  to  stand  up  to  black  women  in 
a  confrontation  situation.  Moreover, 
a  few  of  the  black  women  used  the 
credit  union  to  play  out  some  very 
heavy  anger  at  white  people,  and 
most  of  the  white  women  responded 
with  withdrawal.  And  finally,  white 
staffers  who  tried  to  speak  up  for 
consistent  loan  policies  were  left  all 
alone,  perhaps  out  of  fear  on  the  part 
of  those  who  supported  them  that 
they  would  also  be  accused  of  racism. 

Race  is  a  bit  like  sexual  orien- 
tation: everyone  is  aware  of  it,  but  no 
one  will  talk  about  it.  Everyone  was 
afraid  to  ask,  "Is  there  any  difference 
in  the  number  of  delinquent  loans  for 
black  and  white  women?"  Finally, 
when  it  was  too  late  for  anyone  to 
listen  to  reason,  a  black  board 
member  did  ask  that  question.  There 
was  no  difference.  The  proportion  of 
delinquent  loans  held  by  black 
women  was  the  same  as  the  propor- 
tion of  black  women  originally 
receiving  loans  —  twenty-five  percent.5 

However,  a  second  study,  done  by 
a  board  member  after  the  credit  union 


Organizers'  Dialogue/31 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


closed,  showed  very  different  results. 
As  of  September,  1976,  36%  of  all 
loan  holders  were  delinquent  (more 
than  three  months  overdue)  but  a 
significantly  higher  proportion  of  the 
members  of  Black  Women  United  in 
Struggle  (59%)  were  delinquent.6 

Numbers  can  be  powerful,  but 
they  are  meaningless  without  inter- 
pretation. This  difference  between 
black  and  white  groups  in  propor- 
tions of  delinquent  borrowers  does 
not  mean  that  black  women  are  in- 
herently bad  credit  risks.  In  light  of 
the  first  (board  requested)  study 
which  showed  no  difference  by  race, 
the  data  means  that  something  was 
happening  at  CFFCU  in  the  year  or 
so  between  the  two  studies  which 
caused  or  allowed  differences  related 
to  race  to  occur. 

Part  of  the  explanation  for  the  in- 
creased delinquency  rate  among 
black  women  is  that  outreach  efforts 
to  black  women  were  most  effective 
in  bringing  in  members  from  poorer 
communities,  and  poor  women  as  a 
group  are  less  likely  to  be  able  to 
repay  a  loan.  It  is  also  possible  that 
after  the  original  credit  committee 
dissolved,  there  was  enough 
emotional  trauma  remaining  over  the 
racial  issue  that  succeeding  credit 
committees  went  on  bending  over 
backward  to  give  loans  to  black 
women.  In  fact,  the  credit  committee 


did  make  some  very  bad  loans,  most- 
ly to  black  women. 

Selective  treatment  also  deals  with 
black  women  as  a  class  instead  of  as 
individuals.  It  just  sets  them  up  for 
white  women  to  turn  around  and  say 
"aha!  We  lent  you  our  money  and 
look  how  irresponsible  you  were  with 
it."  To  avoid  this,  it  is  vital  that  any 
organization  involving  blacks  and 
whites  have  very  clearly-stated, 
mutually  formulated  guidelines  for 
how  the  goodies  are  to  be  distributed. 

Also,  black  women  will  have  to 
educate  white  women,  in  a  sisterly 
way,  to  understand  their  subtly  racist 
behavior  patterns.  It's  true  that  many 
blacks  have  had  enough  of  trying  to 
educate  white  folks,  but  many  white 
movement  women,  having  eliminated 
the  more  obvious  manifestations  of 
their  racisms,  are  now  so  insecure 
about  what  to  say  or  do  that  they  just 
avoid  interactions  with  black  women. 
An  impasse  has  been  reached,  and  it 
is  time  for  women  of  both  races  to 
talk  and  try  again  to  understand  each 
other. 

Money  Facts 

A  CFFCU  board  member  did  a 
membership  and  financial  analysis  of 
the  credit  union  after  it  closed.7  The 
Women's  Center,  which  was  the 
founding    organization    of    CFFCU,

Organizers'  Dialogue 


was  also  clearly  the  financial 
backbone  of  the  credit  union.  With 
less  than  half  of  the  members,  it 
provided  two-thirds  of  the  savings 
on  deposit.  These  members'  commit- 
ment is  shown  by  their  high  average 
savings  level  and  low  delinquency 
rate. 

Members  of  BWUIS  used  the 
credit  union  primarily  for  its  loan 
services.  This  was  fine  for  the  credit 
union  since  loan  money  has  to  go  out 
in  order  for  interest  income  to  come 
in.  However,  the  drain  on  resources 
created  by  the  high  delinquency  rate 
of  this  group  was  a  problem.  NOW 
and  the  Women's  Political  Caucus 
were  never  very  active  participants  in 
CFFCU.  They  had  been  recruited  to 
bring  in  middle-class  money  and 
stability,  but  the  outreach  efforts  of 
CFFCU  women  shifted  from  savers 
to  borrowers  very  early  on. 

These  data,  and  more,  were 
available  to  the  credit  union,  but  one 
basic  business  practice  that  they 
never  learned  was  how  to  take 
statistical  information  from  ongoing 
operations  and  use  it  to  change  faulty 
practice.  At  CFFCU,  the  process  of 
what  they  were  doing  got  a  lot  more 
attention  than  their  bookkeeping. 
Too  few  women  learned  the  technical 
aspects  of  running  a  credit  union, 
and  CFFCU  didn't  use  the 
resources  available.  For  example,  their 


National  Credit  Union  Administra- 
tion liaison  was  dubbed"Ed  the  Fed," 
and  his  sincere  plea  to  "ask  for  help 
before  you  get  into  trouble,"  was  ig- 
nored. 

Certainly  not  everyone  at  CFFCU 
had  these  attitudes.  But  as  a  rule,  the 
CFFCU  focus  revolved  around  those 
who  espoused  idealistic  but  often  un- 
realistic positions.  They  were  the 
better  talkers,  and  it  is  more  exciting 
to  discuss  future  expansion  than  im- 
mediate money  deficits.  Too  often 
talkers  turn  out  to  be  non-doers,  but 
that  was  not  the  case  at  CFFCU, 
where  everyone  worked  incredibly 
hard.  There  are  no  villainesses  in 
this  story.  Individual  women  did  and 
didn't  do  things  that  will  provoke 
discussions  in  New  Haven  for  years 
to  come,  but  no  one  has  ever 
questioned  the  very  real  commitment 
of  every  one  of  them  to  the  credit  un- 
ion. CFFCU's  failure  cannot  be  at- 
tributed to  laziness,  ego  tripping,  or 
lack  of  dedication. 

An  additional  study  of  loans  and 
delinquencies  was  done  after  the 
organization  folded.  The  findings  are 
sobering,  because  they  confirm  the 
fear  that  often  you  will  not  be  able  to 
give  loans  to  women  who  need  them 
most.  Loans  most  likely  to  go 
delinquent  were  in  certain  fairly 
predictable  categories:  abortion  loans 
—    particularly   late-term   abortions;

bill  consolidations,  and  security 
deposits  on  apartments.  This  does 
not  mean  that  a  feminist  credit  union 
should  not  make  such  loans,  but  it 
does  mean  that  individuals  falling 
into  these  categories  will  need  careful 
review  by  the  loan  officer,  evidence 
of  a  real  bond  with  her  membership 
organization,  and  support  and  advice 
from  credit  union  women. 

The  credit  committee  thought  they 
dealt  responsibly  with  these  high-risk 
loans  by  requiring  collateral  and/or  a 
co-signer.  In  practice,  however,  the 
co-signer's  ability  to  repay  was  rarely 
verified,  and  most  poor  women  have 
only  their  furniture  or  an  old  car  for 
collateral.  And  finally,  the  most  bitter 
pill  of  all,  the  credit  union  found  that 
even  women  display  the  disturbingly 
human  tendency  to  take  the  money 
and  run.  Borrowers  changed  ad- 
dresses and  went  to  unlisted  phones 
so  the  credit  committee  couldn't  track 
them  down.  Women  on  unemploy- 
ment, knowing  their  payments  could 
not  be  attached  by  a  collection  agen- 
cy, simply  ignored  demands  for 
repayment. 

There  were  some  rays  of  light. 
Welfare  status  per  se  was  not  a  factor 
in  bad  loans.  Women  receiving 
AFDC  lived  on  such  a  financial 
precipice  that  they  often  were  very 
skillful  at  budgeting  the  money  they 
did  have.   Also  some  feminists  did 


respond  to  the  "common  bond"  and 
were  good  loan  risks  even  though 
their  sources  of  income  or  seeming 
ability  to  repay  were  not  traditional. 

A  Common  Bond 

The  strength  of  a  credit  union  is  in 
its  "common  bond"  and  CFFCU 
founders  had  made  much  of  this  term 
because  it  seemed  synonymous  with 
sisterhood.  Actually,  the  intent  of 
this  federal  requirement  was  to  make 
sure  credit  union  members  knew  each 
other  and  could  bring  peer  pressure 
to  bear  on  delinquent  loans;  if  the 
woman  working  next  to  you  on  the 
assembly  line  didn't  pay  up,  you 
could  be  pretty  direct  about  letting 
her  know  it  wasn't  very  sisterly  to 
default  on  your  money.  But  at 
CFFCU,  with  women  almost  en- 
couraged to  walk  in  off  the  street  and 
apply  for  loans,  there  was  just  no 
way  to  force  repayment,  and  the 
delinquency  rate  when  they 
closed  —  13%  compared  to  a  national 
average  of  3%— showed  it. 

Feminist  credit  unions  consciously 
encourage  women  to  borrow  money 
under  non-traditional  circumstances, 
but  such  a  policy  can  only  work  if 
women  are  educated  to  the  value  and 
responsibility  of  a  credit  union  and 
believe  it  is  their  own.  CFFCU  was 
not  able  to  bring  enough  women  into 


34/Quesf 


Organizers9  Dialogue 


its  process  and  inspire  commitment 
to  the  organization.  Furthermore, 
those  groups  which  originally  made 
up  the  credit  union,  and  supposedly 
gave  it  its  common  bond,  never  took 
responsibility  for  educating  their 
members  about  it.  Such  education 
had  been  intended,  but  they  were 
never  able  to  accomplish  it  for  lack  of 
time  and  money. 

Additionally,  with  all  the  emphasis 
at  CFFCU  on  making  loans,  there 
was  not  nearly  enough  consideration 
given  to  the  other  half  of  the 
recycling  system— savings.  In  the 
beginning  it  was  just  expected  that 
feminists  would  put  their  money  into 
the  credit  union,  and  many  did.  But 
CFFCU  women  never  put  much 
energy  into  recruiting  savers.  This 
lack  of  encouragement  was  a  func- 
tion of  the  women's  movement  at- 
titude that  it's  not  quite  nice  to  have 
money,  and  downright  politically  in- 
correct to  have  a  lot  of  it.  Realistically 
though,  to  survive,  a  feminist  credit 
union  will  have  to  actively  recruit 
middle-class  and  upper-class  women 
too,  because  that  is  where  the  money 
is. 

It  would  be  unfair  to  the  women  of 
CFFCU  to  write  this  article  without 
talking  about  the  good  they  were  able 
to  accomplish  in  its  short  life. 
CFFCU  was  willing  to  look  at  a 
woman  as  a  person  in  her  own  right, 


with  her  own  income.  They  did  allow 
unusual  kinds  of  income,  such  as 
alimony,  welfare  and  unemployment, 
that  banks  usually  don't  credit  to  a 
woman.  They  did  attempt  to  reach 
out  to  women  in  Puerto  Rican  and 
black  communities.  They  did  try  to 
be  more  human  in  the  loan  process, 
and  they  never  turned  down  an  abor- 
tion loan. 

Is  It  Worth  It? 

Should  feminists  start  their  own 
credit  unions?  The  answer,  in  my 
opinion,  is  a  very  qualified  yes.  On 
the  practical  side,  they  must  be  able 
to  meet  certain  preconditions  in  order 
to  succeed:  location  in  an  area  having 
enough  feminists  to  support  the  in- 
stitution with  both  savings  and 
loans;  active  involvement  of  people 
knowledgeable  in  accounting,  com- 
puterized record-keeping,  analysis  of 
financial  data  and  credit  union 
operations,  or  willingness  to  learn 
these  skills  before  opening  up;  suf- 
ficient resources  to  carry  the  credit 
union  through  the  first  two  years  and 
a  commitment  from  groups  con- 
stituting the  "common  bond"  to 
educate  and  involve  their  members. 

In  operating  a  credit  union,  there 
are  certain  business  basics  which 
even  the  revolution  won't  alter. 
Financial  records  must  be   accurate

and  maintained  consistently,  and 
money  loaned  out  has  to  come  back 
in.  Beyond  this,  it  may  be  possible  to 
create  a  working  environment  which 
is  more  humane  than  the  usual 
business,  but  feminists  will  have  to 
experiment  with  care.  Collectivity 
and  diffusion  of  power  are  not  well 
suited  to  an  institution  so  rigidly 
structured  by  federal  regulation  and 
inherent  technical  considerations. 

The  final  practical  consideration  is 
the  realization  that  a  credit  union 
requires  a  much  longer  commitment 
than  almost  any  other  alternative  in- 
stitition.  An  abortion  clinic  or 
women's  center  can  provide 
meaningful  services  for  a  few  years 
and  then  close  without  too  many  con- 
sequences. But  closing  a  credit  union 
has  major  repercussions,  since  it 
affects  the  ongoing  financial  plans  of 
many  hundreds  of  people.  More  im- 
portantly, time  is  essential  to  the 
growth  and  usefulness  of  money.  It 
takes  many  years  for  a  credit  union  to 
build  up  enough  assets  to  be  really 
stable. 

On  the  political  side,  the  first  task 
is  to  be  very  clear  about  what  a 
feminist  credit  union  can  and  cannot 
do.  As  an  institution,  credit  unions 
are  a  little  bit  more  than  a  flea  in  the 
ear  of  capitalism.  Banks  don't  like 
credit  unions  because  they  are 
democratically  organized  and  most  of 


their  money  goes  to  membership  ser- 
vices rather  than  into  bankers' 
pockets.  On  the  other  hand,  a 
feminist  credit  union  is  severely 
limited  as  an  income-sharing  device 
because  demand  for  its  money  will 
always  far  exceed  supply.  Making 
decisions  about  who  will  or  will  not 
get  this  money  gives  the  kind  of 
power  over  other  people's  lives  that 
most  feminists  will  find  uncomfor- 
table. Women  starting  a  credit  union 
will  have  to  consider  whether  they 
want  to  accept  this  kind  of  respon- 
sibility and  power. 

Most  feminists  have  a  love-hate 
relationship  with  money.  The  love 
part  is  that  money  is  power,  and 
power  is  necessary  to  accomplish 
change.  The  hate  part  is  a  complex  of 
factors:  middle-class  guilt 
at  "having";  resistance  to  its  corrupt- 
ing influence  and  ignorance  of  what 
really  big  money  is.  Feminists  in  credit 
unions  will  have  to  deal  with  these  am- 
bivalencies.  Their  attitudes  so  far  have 
been  predominantly  negative,  resulting 
in  ignorance  of  how  money  works, 
resistance  to  dealing  with  people  who 
have  money,  and  guilt  feelings  toward 
people  who  don't  have  money.  It  is 
time  we  recognized  that  women  do 
need  to  have  some  savings  and  it  makes 
sense  to  make  those  savings  work  for 
us  instead  of  them. 


36/Quest 


Organizers'  Dialogue 


The  most  important  political 
reason  for  establishing  a  feminist 
credit  union  is  that  it  gives  women  an 
opportunity  to  learn  how  money 
works.  Money  is  power;  that  power 
can  corrupt  but  without  it,  we'll 
never  bring  about  fundamental  social 
change.  And  we  can't  change  the 
system  without  understanding  how  it 
works.  A  credit  union  is  almost  the 
only  opportunity  available  for 
feminists  to  deal  with  even  moderate- 
ly large  amounts  of  money.  However, 
the  opportunity  should  be  undertaken 
only  with  the  realization  that  the  poten- 
tial for  disastrous  failure  is  directly 
proportional  to  the  potential  for 
dramatic  success.

Organizers9  Dialogue 


Beverly    Stone    from    Chicagoland 
Continues: 

Without  having  read  Christine 
Pattee's  article  and  without  knowing 
much  of  the  history  of  the  New 
Haven  Feminist  Federal  Credit 
Union,  I  can  well  imagine  that  its 
principal  problem  was  inadequacy  in 
developing  "good  business  practices 
as  opposed  to  feminist  politics."  As 
the  organizer  of  the  Chicagoland 
Women's  Federal  Credit  Union,  I  will 
share  what  I  have  learned  about 
business  and  feminist  politics. 

I  had  dreamed  that  we  would  be  a 
million-dollar  institution  within  a 
year  of  our  opening.  One  and  one- 
half  years  since  our  opening,  we  have 
$50,000  in  deposits  and  have  loaned 
$65,000  during  that  time.  Women  in 
Chicagoland,  feminist  or  not,  have 
not  supported  our  credit  union  the 
way  I  had  imagined  they  would. 
Why?  Because  they  have  not  put 
their  money  where  their  mouths  are! 
The  handful  of  women  who  have 
devoted  time  and  energy  to  the  start- 
up of  our  credit  union  have  taken 
their  jobs  seriously  and  responsibly. 
We  have  learned  much  about  run- 
ning a  business  and  in  this  regard  I 
believe  we  are  satisfied.  But  we  have 
not  even  scratched  the  surface  in 
terms  of  our  potential  economic 
power.  Why? 


1.  Dividends:  We  cannot  declare  a 
dividend  until  we  have  generated 
substantial  income.  We  cannot 
generate  substantial  income  until  we 
have  loaned  out  a  lot  of  money.  We 
can't  lend  out  a  lot  of  money  until  we 
have  generous  deposits.  And  the 
women  in  Chicagoland  keep  telling 
us  they  will  put  their  money  into  the 
credit  union  once  we  declare  a 
dividend!  Tell  us  about  feminist 
politics!* 

2.  Loan  Policy:  We  have  had  few, 
if  any,  requests  for  loans  which  are 
based  on  feminist  politics.  We  get  the 
same  kind  of  loan  requests  that  the 
banks  do,  and  we  extend  loans  that 
are  much  riskier  than  any  financial 
institution  is  willing  to  make,  unless 
they  charge  exorbitant  interest  rates, 
which  some  do! 

3.  Delinquency  rate:  We  have  a 
much  higher  rate  of  delinquencies 
than  most  credit  unions.  80%  of  all 
credit  unions  are  industrial  credit  un- 
ions that  won't  even  extend  a  loan 
unless  the  borrower  is  on  a  payroll 

*78%  of  all  our  deposits  are  $5-25  savings  ac- 
counts. If  I  deposit  $100  in  a  bank  savings  ac- 
count for  one  year  at  5%  compounded  daily  I 
would  receive  $5.14  in  interest  at  the  end  of 
the  year.  Dividends?  How  many  of  us  piss 
away  $5.14  whenever  we  get  the  chance?! 

What  we  need  is  for  more  women  to  go  into 
business  so  that  we  can  all  understand  what  it 
takes  to  generate  profit  and  then  let's  talk 
about  spreading  the  wealth!

deduction  plan!  Collecting  on 
delinquent  and  late  loans  is  time- 
consuming  and  costly  in  terms  of 
womanpower.  Some  women  do  have 
loyalty  to  us  and  pay  their  loans  on 
time.  But  we  have  others  who  could 
care  less  .  .  .  and  that  includes  self- 
declared  feminists,  too. 

4.  Staff:  We  have  450  members.  I 
have  worked  fulltime  with  the  credit 
union  and  have  two  part-timers,  and 
we  have  worked  without  pay.  I  truly 
believe  that  few  of  our  450  members 
have  even  stopped  to  ask  themselves 
how  working  without  pay  affects  the 
lives  of  those  of  us  who  have  done  so. 
Where  does  this  question  come  up  in 
feminist  politics? 

My  conclusion  can  only  be  that,  as 
in  every  human  endeavor,  female  or 
male,  few  will  take  the  risk  and 
accept  the   responsibility.   Everyone 


else  will  come  along  for  the  ride,  and 
only  if  it  promises  to  be  a  pleasurable 
ride  at  that. 

If  I  had  it  to  do  over,  I  would  do  it 
again,  but  with  qualifications.  I 
would  not  open  the  doors  without 
deposits  pledged  up  front;  I  would 
not  open  the  doors  unless  staff  were 
guaranteed  at  least  a  living  wage;  and 
I  would  devote  more  time  to  dealing 
with  the  question  of  what  to  do  with 
delinquent  loans  and  less  time  to 
feminist  rhetoric. 

And,  last,  but  not  least,  if  I  did  it 
over,  I  would  not  have  borrowed 
money  to  live  on  and  feed  my 
daughters  with,  so  that  I  could  now 
feel  less  angry  about  the  time,  money 
and  effort  I  have  spent.  An  avocation 
can  be  enjoyed.  A  vocation  that  puts 
you  in  the  hole  financially  is  a  bad 
trip.

Sexual  Politics 

By  JACKIE  MacMILLAN     graphics  by  Jackie  MacMillan 


Prostitution  is  an  issue  of  sexual 
politics.  It  is  part  of  a  society  in 
which  women  are  dominated  by 
men— both  by  individual  men  and  by 
the  social  structure  as  a  whole.  Male 
domination  is  cultural  as  well  as 
simply  economic.  Attitudes  toward 
prostitution  reveal  our  cultural 
assumptions— the  assumptions  of  a 
male  dominated  society— about  the 
roles  women  can  have.  The  ideology 
of  our  society  says  that  women's  role 
is  to  serve  the  sexual  needs  of  men. 
At  the  same  time,  this  ideology 
measures  masculinity  by  sexual 
prowess.  To  use  women  for  sexual 
purposes  in  this  society  is  considered 
a  determinant  of  manhood.  Men  have 
not  only  created  a  market  for  sexual 
services;  they  have  insured  that  this 
demand  will  be  met  almost  exclusive- 
ly by  women  by  assigning  women  a 
primarily  sexual  function  and 
limiting  their  economic  mobility. 

Prostitution  is  a  Feminist  Issue 

Our  male-dominated  culture  sees 
women's  sexuality  as  a  great  natural 
resource.  They  have  made  dressing 
and  acting  a  sexual  part  one  of  the 
few  means  women  have  for  survival. 
They  have  created  a  culture  in  which 
acting    this    part    becomes    second 


nature  for  women.  Men  expect  this 
kind  of  behavior.  It  validates  their 
fantasies  about  women  as  primarily 
sexual  beings.  Lower-class  women  in 
particular  are  likely  to  be  regarded  as 
sexually  available  because,  in  this 
case,  myths  about  female  sexuality 
work  together  with  cultural  myths 
about  lower-class  "loose  morals." 

Prostitution  is  an  important  issue 
for  feminists  because  prostitutes 
most  clearly  express  the  cultural 
valuation  and  image  of  women  as 
primarily  sexual  beings.  Their 
behavior  and  dress  simply  make 
explicit  the  expected  female  behavior. 
They  are  explicitly  marketing  a 
sexual  product/service.  Prostitutes 
approach  their  work  in  a  calculated, 
sexually  detached  way.  Only  in  male 
fantasies  are  prostitutes  motivated  by 
sexual  drives.  For  women,  genital  ac- 
tivity is  not  necessarily  sexual  activi- 

ty- 

While  many  women  will  never 
turn  a  trick,  the  institution  of 
prostitution  affects  all  women.  The 
illegality  of  prostitution  is  used  to 
control  both  prostitutes  and 
"straight"  women,  and  to  put  them 
against  each  other. 

Prostitution  makes  clear  women's 
status  as,  property  or  commodity. 
Most  women  become  private  proper-

ty  through  marriage.  Marriage 
requires  a  woman  to  submit  to  the 
control  of  an  individual  man.  She 
must  provide  a  number  of  services 
for  her  husband,  including  sexual 
services;  and  she  is  expected  to  be 
sexually  monogamous.  All  this  is  sup- 
ported by  the  force  of  law. 


Marriage  provides  an  important 
economic  function  for  capitalism,  by 
maintaining  women  as  a  surplus 
labor  force  and  providing  a  structure, 
the  family,  for  nurturing  children 
and  male  workers.  Women's 
economic  dependence  on  men  is 
crucial  to  society's  smooth  operation. 


42/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  1,  summer,  1977 


Capitalism  cannot  and  will  not  ac- 
comodate women's  work  on  an  equal 
basis  with  men. 

Prostitutes,  like  wives,  are  treated 
like  commodities.  But  in  contrast  to 
wives,  prostitutes  are  regarded  as 
public  property.  A  prostitute  sells  sex 
for  money  on  the  open  market. 
"Sporting"  is  a  cherished  indulgence 
for  men.  Yet  society  cannot  afford  to 
openly  condone  prostitution.  The 
monogamous  family  is  supported  by 
social  and  moral  values.  Open  accep- 
tance of  prostitution  would  under- 
mine these  values  and  threaten  the 
family  structure  on  which  this  socie- 
ty so  heavily  depends.  A  facade  of 
condemning  prostitution  is  not  only 
convenient  but  essential  to  masking 
the  real  status  of  all  women.  Prostitu- 
tion laws  are  enforced  according  to 
expediency  or  the  whim  of  those  in 
power.  They  are  enforced  almost 
exclusively  against  prostitutes  rather 
than  their  male  patrons— that  is,  they 
are  enforced  almost  exclusively 
against  women. 

Prostitution  is  a  paradox. 
Although  prostitution  is  illegal,  it  is 
simultaneously  promoted  by  the 
ability  and  willingness  of  men  to  buy 
sexual  services  from  women.  And 
while  it  is  fairly  acceptable  for  men  to 
patronize  prostitutes,  women  are 
heavily  stigmatized  for  turning 
tricks.  It  is  clear  that  not  only  the 
availability  of  prostitutes,  but  the 
laws  and  stigmas  against  prostitutes, 
serve  the  interests  of  men.  They 
make  it  seem  better  to  be  economical- 
ly (and  emotionally)  dependent  on  a 
single  man.  The  laws  are  fundamen- 
tal to  the  male  protection  racket— to 
maintaining  most  women  as  private 
rather  than  public  property.  The 
faithful,    obedient    wife    is    the 


prototypical  Good  Woman— private 
property.  The  prostitute— indepen- 
dent and  "promiscuous"— is  the 
prototypical  Bad  Woman.  Men  have 
attached  positive  and  negative  values 
to  these  images  and  use  them  to 
threaten  and  control  women.  Women 
are  encouraged  to  model  themselves 
after  the  Good  Woman  image.  The 
prostitute  is  supposed  to  serve  as  an 
example  to  "straight"  women— a 
threat  of  what  can  happen  to  her  if 
she  gets  out  of  line.  Society  says  to 
women,  "If  you  follow  the  example 
of  the  prostitute,  you  will  be  subject 
to  abuse."* 

Margo  St.  James,  founder  of 
COYOTE  ("a  loose  women's 
organization"  dealing  with  education 
and  advocacy),  has  explained  that  the 
label  "whore"  has  been  used  to  con- 
trol the  behavior  of  "straight" 
women.  Women  who  walk  alone,  go 
to  bars  alone  or  with  other  women,  or 
behave  in  a  generally  independent 
manner,  are  considered  to  be  sexually 
available.  Thus,  unescorted  women 
are  labelled  "whore"  and  treated  with 
contempt  —  available  to  be  com- 
mented on  by  any  man  on  the  street, 
available  to  be  "picked  up"  and 
harassed  in  other  ways.  This  puts 
pressure  on  women  to  have  male 
escorts,  to  remain  at  home,  or  to 
otherwise  restrict  their  behavior.  It 
limits  women's  mobility,  promotes 
women's  dependence  on  men,   and 

*Lower  and  working-class  women  are,  to  a 
certain  extent,  automatically  classified  as  "bad 
women"  in  this  society  and  therefore  prostitu- 
tion is  seen  as  a  more  likely  alternative  for 
them  than  for  more  privileged  women.  For  a 
discussion  dealing  with  class  and  the  public 
property  status  of  women,  see  Harold  Barnett, 
"The  Political  Economy  of  Rape  and 
Prostitution,"  Review  of  Radical  Political 
Economy,  vol.  VIII,  No.  1  (Spring,  1976). 


Prostitution/43 


reinforces  the  private  property  status 
of  women. 

Once  again,  the  status  of 
prostitutes  makes  clear  the  real  status 
of  all  women.  St.  James  has  asked 
numerous  vice  officers  what  they 
consider  their  function  to  be  and 
repeatedly  they  have  responded:  "to 
keep  the  girls  off  the  streets  .  .  ." 
Anti-loitering  laws  are  enforced 
almost  exclusively  against  women, 
specifically  against  prostitutes. 
"Straight"  women  rarely  loiter.  By 
harassing  prostitutes,  police  and 
other  men  effectively  keep  all  women 
off  the  street.  Men  can  essentially  go 
where  they  please  and  do  as  they 
please.  Men  can  and  do  "solicit"  and 
harass  women  on  the  street.  Neither 
law  nor  stigma  restricts  this  behavior. 

Feminists  have  often  viewed 
prostitution  from  one  of  two  extreme 
perspectives.  Many  think  that  a 
prostitute  is  a  woman  who  has  been 
forced,  out  of  dire  necessity,  to  turn 
tricks  for  a  living.  They  see  prostitu- 
tion as  the  extreme  degradation  and 
regard  prostitutes  with  pity  and 
horror  because  they  assume  that  a 
woman  would  become  a  prostitute 
only  as  a  last  resort.  At  the  other 
extreme  are  civil  libertarians  who 
view  prostitution  strictly  as  a  matter 
of  personal  choice.  They  assume  that 
a  prostitute,  in  entering  her  profes- 
sion, has  exercised  "free  will."  Both 
these  views  ignore  the  reality  women 
face. 

Prostitution  may  be  the  Best  Choice 

Women  neither  choose  prostitu- 
tion "freely,"  nor  do  they  become 
prostitutes,  because  they  have  ab- 
solutely no  other  choice.  Women 
choose   prostitution   as   a   means   of 


survival  from  among  their  very 
limited  options.  Most  women  are  en- 
couraged  to  survive  through 
marriage.  While  marriage  is  fun- 
damentally an  economic  arrange- 
ment, it  fills  additional  needs  for 
women  that  prostitution  and  other 
jobs  do  not  fill.  Marriage  can  promise 
women  a  reasonably  comfortable  life 
(depending  on  class),  security  and 
male  protection  in  a  world  that  is 
hostile  to  women.  In  addition, 
women  seek  love,  affection,  sex,  and 
companionship  from  marriage. 

Marriage  is  more  of  a  survival  op- 
tion for  middle-  and  working-class 
women  than  for  economically  lower- 
class  women.  Poor  women  cannot 
turn  to  their  male  peers  for  economic 
security.  Many  Third  World  and 
poor  white  men  are  unable  to  get  de- 
cent jobs  and  support  families.  Some 
men  even  hold  down  two  full-time 
jobs  and  are  still  unable  to  make  ends 
meet. 

In  this  context,  prostitution 
becomes  particularly  attractive  to 
some  lower-class  women.  During  the 
Industrial  Revolution,  many  women 
became  prostitutes  to  escape  the 
backbreaking  conditions  of  industrial 
labor  or  to  supplement  their  earnings 
as  industrial  workers.  Third  World 
and  poor  white  women  today  are 
offered  the  "dirtiest"  jobs  for  the 
lowest  wages.  Welfare  is  an  unattrac- 
tive alternative  to  many  women 
because  of  inadequate  payments, 
legal  restrictions,  and  the  humiliation 
of  having  to  submit  to  the  scrutiny  of 
caseworkers.  Under  these  conditions, 
respectability  becomes  less  important 
and  the  relatively  good  earnings  of 
prostitutes  become  more  attractive. 
The  apparent  glamour  and  excite- 
ment   associated    with    prostitution 


44/Quest 


also  serves  as  inducements  to  many 
women  who,  because  of  limited  op- 
portunities, see  prostitution  as  their 
only  escape  from  the  drudgery  that 
goes  with  other  forms  of  survival. 

Women  are  probably  more  likely 
to  get  involved  in  prostitution  when 
it  is  part  of  their  cultural  environ- 
ment, when  prostitution  is  visable  in 
the  community,  when  it  is  discussed 
casually,  and  possibly  when  a  friend 
or  peer  is  a  prostitute  or  pimp. 
Lower-class  and  black  communities 
tend  to  be  relatively  more  tolerant  of 
prostitutes  than  middle-class  white 
communities.  Poor  communities,  es- 
pecially those  that  are  non-white,  are 
generally  more  aware  of  the  survival 
aspects  of  prostitution. 

Although  prostitution  may  be  par- 
ticularly attractive  to  lower-class 
women,  women  with  relatively  good 


options  may  still  choose  it  over 
marriage  and/or  a  straight  job.  Such 
women  may  feel  that  the  restrictions 
of  marriage  are  even  more  oppressive 
than  prostitution.  In  addition, 
prostitution  offers  women  a  potential 
for  economic  independence. 
Traditionally,  prostitutes  earn  more 
than  most  other  women  workers. 
Many  women  are  attracted  to  the 
working  conditions  as  well  as  the 
higher  earnings  of  prostitution.  Most 
"women's  jobs,"  including  many 
white-collar  jobs,  are  extremely 
tedious  and  confining.  Prostitution 
offers  a  kind  of  independence  and 
physical  mobility  other  jobs  lack.  The 
element  of  self-management  in- 
volved, at  least  for  women  indepen- 
dent of  pimps,  may  be  an  important 
consideration  for  a  woman  who  has 
worked  in  a  tightly  restricted  en- 
vironment. 

For  some  women,  prostitution  can 
be  a  means  of  upward  mobility.  A 
prostitute  who  saves  her  money  may 
be  able  to  invest  in  a  small  business. 
Prostitution  can  be  a  fast  way  to 
make  money  for  school.  Prostitution 
can  also  be  an  emergency  measure 
that  a  woman  with  another  job  can 
fall  back  on  in  a  crisis. 

Obviously  the  oppressive  con- 
ditions of  prostitution  outweigh  the 
benefits  for  many  other  women. 
While  a  woman  may  enjoy  a  warm 
spring  afternoon  outside,  a 
streetwalker  must  also  endure  cold 
winter  nights  in  minimal  clothing. 
Moreover,  prostitutes  are  particular- 
ly vulnerable  to  robbery,  rape,  and 
other  physical  assault.  Constant 
physical  contact  with  men  can  itself 
create  mental  and  physical  health 
problems  for  prostitutes.  The  social 
stigma   associated   with   prostitution 


Prostitution/45 


can  also  be  a  severe  handicap  and 
prevent  prostitutes  from  establishing 
credit,  changing  occupation,  or 
otherwise  participating  in  straight 
society.  Most  significantly,  the  il- 
legality of  prostitution  makes  it  a 
dangerous  and  insecure  profession 
that  can  cost  a  woman  dearly  in  terms 
of  time,  money,  and  status  if  she  is 
arrested. 

Women  who  come  from  more 
privileged  backgrounds  have  better 
economic  alternatives  from  which  to 
choose  in  the  first  place,  and  usually 
have  more  resources  to  help  them  in 
carrying  out  their  work  as  prosti- 
tutes. These  women  are  more  often 
able  to  work  indoors,  command 
higher  prices,  and  depend  less  on 
pimps.  But  many  prostitutes  have  lit- 
tle choice  but  to  carry  on  their  work 
in  the  streets,  often  under  the  control 
of  a  pimp.  The  streets  are  controlled 
by  men.  While  pimps  provide  some 
useful  services,  there  is  no  clear 
reason  why  these  services  could  not 
be  provided  by  women,  and  in  some 
rare  cases,  they  are.  But  the  role  is 
still  essentially  exploitative.  Pimps 
provide  protective  services  to  "their 
women."  They  protect  prostitutes 
from  unruly  clients,  from  police,  and 
especially  from  other  pimps.  In  this 
respect,  the  Life  is  not  considerably 
different  from  "straight"  society 
since  there,  too,  the  male  protection 
racket  operates.  Pimps  also  act  as 
business  managers,  dealing  with 
financial  and  legal  affairs. 

My  point  in  all  this  is  not  to  deter- 
mine whether  prostitution  is  a  valid 
profession  for  women,  but  rather  to 
point  out  that  feminists  should 
recognize  it  as  a  valid  option.  Given 
the  lack  of  other  choices  for  women, 
each    woman    must    determine    for 


herself  what  her  best  option  is  at  any 
particular  time. 

Prostitution  is  not  just  a 
Personal  Choice 

Some  groups  have  seen  prostitu- 
tion as  a  human  rights  issue. 
Promoting  individual  choice  for 
women  is  fundamental  to  feminism. 
However,  feminists  must  work  for 
individual  rights  in  a  context  that 
recognizes  the  overall  oppression  of 
women.  Otherwise  individual  rights 


46/Quest 


movements  have  the  potential  of  un- 
dermining the  broader  feminist 
political  struggle. 

The  American  Civil  Liberties 
Union  National  Project  on  Sexual 
Privacy  concentrates  on  discrimina- 
tion against  gay  people  and 
prostitutes.  This  is  an  important  and 
worthwhile  project.  However,  an 
endeavor  that  lumps  prostitution 
together  with  gay  rights  under  the 
label  of  "sexual  privacy"  is  based  on 
questionable  assumptions.  The  con- 
cept of  sexual  privacy  is  misleading. 
It  affirms  the  stereotyped  view  of 
prostitution  as  a  sexual  activity. 
Homosexuality  is  a  life-style  option 
—  a  sexual/emotional  orientation  to 
life.**  Prostitution  is  a  professional 
or  economic  option,  unrelated  to 
sexual/emotional  needs.  While  both 
the  gay  struggle  and  the  struggle  of 
organized  prostitutes  are  important 
to  feminists,  they  are  very  different 
issues. 

A  civil  liberties  approach  to 
prostitution  implies  that  a  prostitute 
and  her  client  are  equals;  that  their 
interests  are  mutually  and  reciprocal- 
ly served  by  prostitution,  and  that 
their  supposed  mutual  interest  is  con- 
trary to  the  interests  of  society.  For 

**Clearly  the  choice  of  a  lesbian  lifestyle  has 
an  economic  impact  on  women.  For  most 
middle-class  and  working-class  women,  the 
choice  to  live  without  a  man  involves 
forfeiting  a  certain  amount  of  economic 
privilege.  In  addition,  specific  economic 
reprisals  are  often  made  against  lesbians: 
women  often  lose  their  jobs  when  they  are 
open  about  their  lesbianism.  More  broadly, 
lesbianism  is  a  threat  to  the  system.  It  does  not 
fit  into  the  economic  scheme  of  things;  it 
doesn't  foster  the  economic  dependence  of 
women  on  individual  men.  Most  lesbians  do 
not  choose  a  gay  lifestyle  for  economic 
reasons,  although  this  choice  generally 
produces  economic  ramifications. 


example,  civil  libertarians  have 
argued  "The  issue  of  prostitution 
...  is  basic  to  the  democratic  concept 
of  a  balance  between  individual 
freedom  and  social  good."  They  ask, 
"How  can  a  balance  be  maintained 
between  the  effect  of  individual 
freedom  on  society  and  the  erosion  of 
freedom  of  choice  which  is  caused  by 
restricting  individual  activities?" 

In  reality,  however,  a  prostitute 
and  her  client  share  a  common  in- 
terest only  in  the  most  immediate 
sense  that  the  two  parties  wish  to 
transact  business  together.  On  a. 
larger  scale  this  view  overlooks  the 
power  differentials  that  divide  in- 
dividuals, and  that  allows  one  person 
to  buy  physical  intimacy  with  the 
other.  Second,  on  a  societal  level,  a 
civil  libertarian  approach  assumes 
that  society  is  a  unified  whole,  and 
that  at  times  the  good  of  society  con- 
flicts with  the  rights  of  individuals. 
This  view  ignores  the  context  of 
power  relationships  and  group  in- 
terests and  the  division  of  sex,  race, 
and  class.  It  tacitly  accepts  the  class 
system  and  the  status  of  women  as 
sexual  objects. 

Third,  the  civil  libertarian  concept 
of  sexual  privacy  implies  that 
"consenting  adults"  make  "free 
choices."  It  assumes  that  at  a  certain 
age,  designated  by  law,  people 
suddenly  achieve  total  self- 
determination.  But  women's 
economic  and  political  choices  are 
determined  by  a  male-dominated 
social  system.  Women  can  "freely" 
choose  prostitution  only  from  among 
a  few  restricted  options. 

The  law  is  based  on  the  myth  of 
equal  opportunity  and  free  will. 
Nevertheless,  feminist  lawyers  and 
reformers    should    avoid,    whenever 


Prostitution/47 


possible,  depoliticizing  the  issue  of 
prostitution.  Prostitution,  for  exam- 
ple could  be  explained  as  a  "private 
contracts"  issue,  rather  than  as  a 
sexual  privacy  issue.  Although 
feminists  may  use  the  law,  it  is  im- 
portant to  be  clear  that  we  do  not 
accept  the  ideology  it  is  based  on. 

Prostitution  Should  Be 
Decriminalized 

Most  feminists  agree  that  prostitu- 
tion is  oppressive  to  women.  Many 
of  us  feel  that  prostitution  should  be 
eventually  eliminated.  But  when? 
How?  Under  what  circumstances  can 
this  happen? 

Prostitution  will  not  disappear  as 
long  as  the  market  exists  and  as  long 
as  women's  options  are  severly 
restricted.  Prostitution  currently 
flourishes  in  spite  of  its  illegal  status, 
and  it  is  unlikely  that  prostitution 
can  ever  be  eliminated  in  a  patriarchal 
culture.  The  elimination  of  prostitu- 
tion will  accompany  other  radical 
changes  in  the  lives  of  women.  It  will 
result  from  a  process  of  on-going 
feminist  struggle  and  the  creation  of 
a  society  where  women  have  power. 

Feminists  must  nevertheless  begin 
to  deal  with  prostitution  now,  first 
because  it  is  part  of  the  real 
experience  of  many  women,  and  se- 
cond because  its  existence  —  and  the 
conditions  surrounding  it  —  affect  all 
women.  Feminist  reformers,  in- 
cluding prostitutes,  are  advocating 
decriminalization  of  prostitution  as 
an  immediate  goal.  These  women  are 
demanding  elimination  of  prostitu- 
tion laws  and  "relegation  of  prostitu- 
tion to  the  category  of  private  con- 
tracts." It  is  important  to  understand 
that    decriminalization    is    different 


from  legalization.  Legalization  can 
entail  varying  degrees  of  government 
regulation  and  control.  Decrim- 
inalization simply  means  that  the 
state  will  make  no  laws  about 
prostitution. 

Most  feminists  think  this  reform 
goal  conflicts  with  the  long  range 
goal  of  eliminating  prostitution 
altogether.  Decriminalization  seems 
to  promote  greater  acceptance  of 
prostitution.  Because  of  this  con- 
tradiction, many  feminists  withdraw 
from  the  issue  in  confusion.  At  one 
extreme,  some  feminists  actively  sup- 
port laws  and  sanctions  against 
prostitution.  They  feel  that  prostitu- 
tion reinforces  the  image  of  women 
as  sex  objects,  and  therefore 
promotes  other  sexist  institutions. 
Others  who  believe  that  women  are 
"forced"  into  prostitution,  or  that 
prostitution  is  "unhealthy",  "de- 
structive," and  so  on,  often  feel  that 
the  laws  deter  women  from  entering 
the  profession  —  essentially  saving 
women  from  themselves. 

This  condescending  attitude 
toward  women  assumes  that  they  are 
incapable  of  recognizing  their  own 
best  interests.  As  mentioned  above, 
the  prostitute  is  not  the  only  woman 
who  is  sexually  objectified.  All 
women  are  regarded  as  sexual 
property;  the  prostitute  merely 
chooses  to  capitalize  on  the  fact. 
Prostitution  is  one  way  of  making  the 
best  of  a  bad  situation,  a  way  some 
women  are  able  to  gain  some  control 
over  their  lives. 

Some  advocates  of  decriminaliza- 
tion go  to  the  opposite  extreme.  They 
view  this  reform  goal  as  an  end  in 
itself,  unrelated  to  more  radical  long- 
range  goals.  These  women  feel  that 
prostitution  is  inevitable.  They  have 


48/Quest 


little  tolerance. for  the  "idealism"  of 
feminist  radicals.  Their  concern  is 
exclusively  for  the  immediate  sur- 
vival needs  and  concerns  of 
prostitutes. 

A  feminist  perspective  must  res- 
pond to  both  of  these  positions. 
Feminists  must  advocate  decrimina- 
lization as  an  immediate  reform  goal 
while  working  towards  the  eventual 
elimination  of  prostitution.  Super- 
fically,  this  may  seem  like  a  con- 
tradiction. Yet,  under  examination  it 
is  clear  that  decriminalization  is  a 
valid  feminist  goal  for  the  following 
reasons: 


Most  obviously,  the  criminal 
status  of  prostitution  serves  no  pur- 
pose for  women.  There  is  no  reason 
to  consider  it  a  crime. 

Decriminalization  asserts  the  right 
of  women  to  control  their  own 
bodies.  Feminists  must  promote  the 
right  of  women  to  make  their  own 
choices,  while  at  the  same  time 
working  to  broaden  the  options  of  all 
women. 

Decriminalization  will  give 
prostitutes  more  actual  control  of 
their  lives.  Enforcement  of  the  laws 
contributes  to  all  other  problems  en- 
countered by  prostitutes  as  they  try 


Prostitution/49 


to  make  a  living.  Decriminalization 
will  1)  reduce  dependence  on  pimps; 
2)  enable  women  to  enter  and  leave 
the  profession  freely;  and  3)  enable 
prostitutes  to  exercise  the  same  rights 
as  other  citizens  —  for  example,  to 
report  crimes  to  the  police. 

Decriminalization  begins  to 
eliminate  the  stigma  of  "whore"  that 
serves  male  interests  by  1)  restricting 
the  freedom  of  all  women;  and  2) 
keeping  women  divided  from  each 
other. 

Decriminalization  of  prostitution 
is  an  important  issue  for  feminists  to 
support.  Like  other  issues  it  can  be 
coopted.  Feminists  must  insure  that 
this  goal  is  not  compromised;  and 
that  the  process  by  which  we  work 
toward  this  reform  does  not  under- 
mine our  ultimate  goals.  Our 
strategies  and  analysis  must  connect 
prostitution  with  the  interests  of  all 
women  and  must  be  developed 
within  the  context  of  long-range  fun- 
damental change.

Remembering 
Who  We  Are 


By  BARBARA  DEMING 

graphics  by  Laurie  McLaughlin 

Dear  Susan  Saxe— 

I  keep  remembering  your  saying 
that  the  feminist  movement  needs  an 
analytical  method,  and  that  leftist 
women  should  teach  their  sisters 
dialectical  materialism.  It  is  "not  a 
male  concept,'\you  urge;  "it  is  a  tool 
of  liberation"— and  would  help  put 
our  life  experience  "into  a  rational 
political  context."  Your  suggestion 
makes  me  anxious. 

I  will  agree  that  history  can  best  be 
understood  by  examining  the 
changing  ways  in  which  we  seek  the 
"means  of  our  subsistence";  and  best 
understood  as  a  story  always  in 
process,  the  constant  motion  of  our 
actions,  interactions  as  we  seek  our 
lives.  I  wouldn't  name  this  concept 
patriarchal.  But  those  who  have  used 
the  dialectical  method  to  date  have 
given  us  a  very  limited  look  at  the 
ways  in  which  we  try  to  find  our 
lives.  And  I  think  that  the  fact  that 
most  of  these  dialecticians  have  been 
men  helps  to  explain  why  they  are 
overlooked  so  much.  I  sent  you  once 
a  copy  of  a  letter  I  wrote  to  Arthur 
Kinoy  and  in  it  I  said  that  Marxists 


had  concentrated  too  much  upon  the 
ownership  and  the  production  of 
things  by  which  we  subsist  and 
scanted  a  study  of  the  ways  in  which 
people  subsist  upon  one  another. 
(And  I  didn't  mean  upon  the  labor  of 
others,  simply— unless  we  can  call  the 
giving  of  attention  a  kind  of  labor.)  If 
men  were  to  make  this  study,  they 
would  have  to  face  the  truth  that  they 
keep  asking  women  to  be  their  sub- 
sistence—taking it  for  granted  that  we 
like  and  even  need  to  live  their  lives. 
An  uncomfortable  question  would  be 
raised:  Do  we  need  our  own  lives?  I 
think  this  is  why  they  look  away 
from  the  obvious  fact  that  such  a 
study  has  to  be  made;  why  it  took  a 
woman,  Kate  Millett,  to  suggest  that 
if  we  want  to  "put  our  life  exper- 
iences into  a  rational  political  con- 
text"—we  have  to  talk  not  merely 
about  the  politics  of  economics  but 
about  "sexual  politics." 

I  have  just  read  Wilhelm  Reich's 
"The  Invasion  Of  Compulsory  Sex 
Morality"  and  was  struck  by  the  fact 
that  even  this  man,  whose  primary 
interest  is  sexuality,  examines  in 
dialectical  fashion  the  long-ago  shift 
from  Mother-Right  to  Father-Right, 
and  suggests  that  "the  central 
mechanism"  of  this  great  shift  was 


52/Quest  vol.  IV,  no.  1,  summer,  1977 


the  ritual  of  the  marriage  gift  — 
which  became  marriage  tribute  rather 
than  gift,  and  then  bride  price;  "the 
first  economic  compulsion  of 
mankind"1,  he  names  it  —  I  was 
struck  by  the  fact  that  even  he  looks 
only  to  economic  interests  for  an 
explanation  of  what  happened  here. 

But  I  can  hear  you  objecting: 
"Why  does  she  immediately  in- 
troduce the  subject  of  Mother- 
Right?"  Do  you  know,  Susan,  since 
writing  my  last  letter  to  you— in 
defense  of  Jane  Alpert  and  her  sup- 
porters—it has  occurred  to  me  to 
wonder  how,  as  a  Marxist,  you  can 
reject  as  absolutely  as  you  do  Alpert's 
vision  of  reaffirmed  Mother-Right. 
For  do  you  remember  the  conclusion 
of  Engels'  "The  Origin  Of  The  Fami- 
ly, Private  Property  And  The  State?" 
He  writes  his  judgment  of 
"civilization"  to  date,  which  is  to  say 
of  patriarchy.  He  notes  that  it  has  ac- 
complished things  with  which 
prepatriarchal  society  was  unable  to 
cope.  "But  it  accomplished  them",  he 
adds,  "by  playing  on  the  most  sordid 
instincts  and  passions  .  .  .  Naked 
greed  has  been  the  moving  spirit  of 
civilization."  And  he  ends  by  quoting 
from  Lewis  Morgan's  "Ancient 
Society":  "a  career  of  which  property 
is  the  end  and  aim"  cannot  be  the 
final  destiny  of  mankind;  and  the 
next  higher  plane  of  society  "Will  be 
a  revival,  in  a  higher  form,  of  the 
liberty,  equality  and  fraternity  (sic) 
of  the  ancient  gentes".1  The  ancient 
gentes  were,  in  their  distinctive  form, 
matriarchal.  So  before  Jane  Alpert 
had  her  vision  of  Mother-Right  reaf- 
firmed, Morgan  and  Engels  had  a  vi- 
sion very  much  related  to  it. 

But  to  return  to  Reich.  I  was 
struck,  I  was  saying,  by  the  fact  that 


even  he  looks  only  to  economic  in- 
terests for  an  explanation  of  the  shift 
from  Mother-Right  to  Father- 
Right— from  marriage  gift  to 
marriage  tribute  and  bride  price.  Like 
Engels,  he  fails  even  to  suggest  the 
possibility  that  sexual  interests  may 
have  been  involved.  He  speaks  of  the 
first  stirrings  of  avarice  and 
ownership  interest— meaning  interest 
in  the  ownership  of  things.  But  he 
doesn't  explain  why  avarice  began  to 
stir— though  he  clearly  assumes  that 
it  did  not  exist  within  the  communal 
maternal  clan.  He  notes  with  Engels 
that  at  a  certain  time  a  surplus  in 
material  goods  began  to  exist.  But  he 
doesn't  explain  why  men  were  moved 
to  claim  this  surplus  for  their  in- 
dividual selves  rather  than  the  clan; 
and  why  they  were  moved  to  begin  to 
exact  a  price  for  things,  in  place  of 
the  exchange  of  gifts  that  had  been 
customary.  He  tells  us  that  the 
marriage  gift  became  "a  preliminary 
step  toward  merchandising".  But 
what  was  the  first  merchandise?  By 
his  own  account,  woman  and  her 
children.  So  why  is  it  not  obvious 
that  sexual  politics  were  involved; 
were,  to  use  a  phrase  of  Engels',  the 
driving  force  behind  the  driving  force 
at  which  he  does  look— the  greed  for 
things  which  began  to  afflict  men 
born  of  another  greed,  more  primary. 
In  my  letter  to  Kinoy  I  suggest  that 
men  were  moved  to  force  the  changes 
that  they  did,  not  because  they  suf- 
fered from  the  lack  of  material 
possessions,  but  because  they  lacked 
self  possession— when  they  compared 
themselves  with  women.  They  felt  a 
need  to  produce  for  themselves  a 
wealth  of  self-regard  that  could 
equal— or  rather  that  could  more  than 
equal— the  rich  sense  of  herself  that 


Remembering  Who  We  are/53

woman  had  because  she  was  the  child 
bearer.  The  fact  that  men  had 
anything  to  do  with  the  birth  of 
children  was  for  a  long  time  un- 
known. Each  new  birth  seemed  to  a 
man,  no  doubt,  an  extension  of 
woman's  self.  He  must  have  felt 
himself  to  be  less  than  she;  and  he 
must  have  resented  having  to  feel 
that  way.  The  tragedy  is,  I  wrote,  that 
when  he  learned  that  he  did  play 
some  part  in  reproduction,  instead  of 
saying  to  himself:  "I  am  more  like 
woman  than  I  had  known  (logically 
enough  —  for  I  am  flesh  of  her 
flesh)"  —  instead  of  saying:  "there  is 
new  life  within  us  all",  he  tried  to 
claim:  "I  am  the  life-giver,  the  child 


is  mine;  and  the  woman  is  mine,  con- 
venient ground  in  which  I  plant  my 
seed".  He  tried,  that  is,  to  produce  his 
new  self  at  woman's  and  at  the  child's 
expense.  The  ownership  interest 
stirring  at  that  time  was  man's  in- 
terest in  owning  women  and 
children. 

When  I  wrote  as  I  did  to  Kinoy,  I 
was  unaware  of  one  fact  that  I 
learned  soon  after  by  reading  Evelyn 
Reed's  "Women's  Evolution".  Men 
moved  to  claim  children  as  their 
property  before  they  learned  that 
they  were  their  natural  biological 
offspring.  Reed  writes,  "before  the 
facts  about  paternity  were  known,  a 
man  'begot'   a  child  not  through  a 


54/Quest 


genetic  process  but  through  a  proper- 
ty transaction";  through  "payment 
in  cattle  of  the  bride  price  and  child 
price."3 

Though  acts  of  purchase  had  not 
existed  before  this  time,  men  now 
managed  to  insist  that  such  acts  had 
awful  power.  The  property  right  to 
children  which  they  purchased  could 
not  be  dissolved  by  the  woman's  re- 
marriage or  even  by  the  man's  death; 
it  could  be  dissolved  only  by  the 
return  of  those  cattle  which  had  been 
the  coin  paid.  If  a  woman  re-married, 
but  the  cattle  had  not  been  returned, 
the  children  of  that  second  marriage 
were  still  "his".  If  a  son  were  born  to 
the  woman  years  after  his  death,  but 
the  cattle  had  not  been  returned,  that 
son  could  still  be  claimed  by  male 
kin,  to  carry  on  his  "name".  When 
the  man  did  learn  that  he  was  a 
biological  father,  he  devised  different 
kinds  of  laws— to  protect  his  status  as 
"progenitor".  But  the  right  he 
demanded  was,  as  before,  a  property 
right— property  in  children  and  in 
woman. 

Knowing  that  he  first  demanded 
this  "right"  while  in  ignorance  of 
paternity,  I  am  more  convinced  than 
ever  that  he  was  seeking  compensa- 
tion for  a  lack  of  naturally  ex- 
perienced pride— dissatisfied  with  the 
self  he  felt  to  be  his,  hoping  to 
produce  a  larger  self  through  his 
purchase  of  "heirs".  And  my  own 
strong  guess  is  that  he  invented  the 
very  concept  of  purchase  to  be  able  to 
demand  these  extensions  of  himself, 
to  be  able  to  produce  his  new  pride.  A 
pride  tragically  abstract.  If  only  he 
had  known  earlier  that  he  was  by 
nature  more  than  his  single  self.  No 
need  to  pretend  to  be.  No  need  for  the 
theft  called  "purchase". 


Small  wonder  that  money  so  often 
obscures  what  should  be  natural 
relationships  between  people.  It 
appears  to  have  been  invented  to 
facilitate  a  lie.  Small  wonder,  too,  that 
women  seldom  have  any  real  control 
over  money.  It  was  invented  to  steal 
from  us  our  independence.  It  had 
better  be  for  us,  I  might  add,  to  dis- 
solve the  perverse  system. 

But  to  return  again  to  Reich. Why 
is  it  that  this  man,  who  writes  that 
sexual  needs  play  a  more  important 
part  in  the  development  of  society 
than  the  need  for  food  (he  writes  this 
in  a  paragraph  in  which  he  "corrects" 
Engels— why  is  it  that  when  he 
examines  the  acts  by  which  men  im- 
posed patriarchy,  he  himself 
overlooks  sexual  interests?  He  makes 
observations  about  the  sexuality  he 
thinks  characterized  prehistory  that 
are  certainly  relevant  to  the  story  of 
the  introduction  of  patriarchy;  then 
seems  to  forget  all  about  them.  When 
he  comes  to  tell  that  story,  he  fails  to 
pick  up  the  thread  of  any  one  of  these 
speculations. 

In  the  days  before  patriarchy,  the 
brother  of  any  woman  who  bore 
children  shared,  with  her,  respon- 
sibility for  those  children.  Reich 
remarks  of  the  brother  that  he  was 
"the  real  husband  of  the  sister  except 
for  the  genital  relationship.  "4He  also 
speaks  of  legends  about  brothers  and 
sisters  living  in  incest;  and  makes  the 
assumption  that  at  this  stage  of 
savagery,  people  did  live  in  in- 
cest—"without  being  in  the  least 
harmed  by  it".  But  there  began  to  be 
restrictions  upon  genital  freedom,  he 
says.  The  first  such  restriction  was 
"the  prohibition  of  the  sexual  em- 
brace within  one's  own  clan."  The 
process    of    sexual    suppression,    he 


Remembering/55 


suggests,  "is  older  than  the  'class 
conflict'  between  man  and  woman 
and  is  the  cause  of  this  antagonism." 
Here  are  observations  one  wouldn't 
suppose  he  would  be  likely  to  forget 
having  made. 

Evelyn  Reed,  by  the  way,  explains 
the  taboo  upon  the  genital  embrace 
within  one's  clan  in  terms  of  the 
women's  attempt  to  protect  their 
children  from  men's  cannibalism. 
She  points  out  that  the  prohibition  of 
mating  by  men  and  women  of  the 
same  clan  was  linked  with  a  prohibi- 
tion against  their  sitting  down  to  eat 
together.  If  one  accepts  her  thesis, 
one  could  speak  of  men's  claim  to 
property  rights  in  children  as  a  kind 
of  renewed  claim  to  cannibal  rights, 
in  a  masked  form.  Did  men  in  those 
earliest  times  perhaps  act  out  the 
assertion  to  women:  "Children  may 
be  born  of  your  bodies,  but  by  eating 
them  I  make  them  mine?" 

If  Reich  believed  that  the  primary 
source  of  antagonism  between  man 
and  woman  was  primitive  woman's 
refusal  of  her  brothers'  embrace,  and 
if  he  saw  the  mother's  brother  as  a 
husband  to  her  except  for  this  em- 
brace, why  didn't  it  interest  him  to 
speculate  upon  the  sexual  feelings  of 
the  mother's  brothers  during  the  time 
patriarchy  was  gaining  its  victory? 
As  Reed  puts  it,  the  victory  of 
patriarchy  was  "the  victory  of  father 
right  over  mother's  brother  right". 
"Only  when  the  mother's  brother 
relinquished  all  claims  to  his  sister's 
son  could  the  father  acquire  it  as  his 
'own'  ".  Although  Reed  speaks  of  "a 
struggle"  here  "between  two 
categories  of  men",  every  man  in- 
volved in  the  struggle  (or  surely 
almost  every  man)  belonged  to  both 
categories— was  mother's  brother  to 


one  woman,  mother's  mate  to 
another.  The  victory  of  patriarchy 
actually  meant  that  one  man  after 
another  chose— the  identity  of  hus- 
band, "father",  over  the  identity  of 
brother.  (And  as  Reed  notes,  the  root 
word  from  which  the  word  for  father 
is  derived  appears  to  mean  'owner')5. 

Why  did  Reich  prefer  not  to 
speculate  upon  the  sexual  interests  of 
the  men  who  chose  as  they  did?  I 
think  that  the  answer  is  obvious.  If 
he  were  to  look  very  closely  at  the  act 
by  which  prehistoric  men  sought  for 
themselves  a  new  self  regard,  he 
would  be  looking  at  the  very  act  by 
which  he  himself  (by  which  any  man) 
still  seeks  his  pride.  Reich  claimed 
that  Engels  was  unable  to  think  clear- 
ly enough  about  the  part  played  in 
history  of  sexuality  because  his  con- 
cept of  sexuality  considered  the 
function  of  procreation  but  left  un- 
touched "the  function  of  genital 
gratification".6  But  Reich,  too,  was 
unable  to  think  about  it  clearly 
enough  because  he  couldn't  make 
himself  look  at  the  truth  that  for 
patriarchal  man  genital  gratification 
requires  the  gratification  of  false 
pride. 

Marxists  to  date  have  sought  "the 
ultimate  cause  and  the  great  moving 
power  of  all  historical  events  in  the 
economic  development  of  society".7 
(The  words  are  Engels'.)  But  we  do 
not  subsist  upon  bread  alone.  I  keep 
remembering  a  passage  in  the  title  es- 
say of  Andrea  Dworkin's  "Our 
Blood"— an  essay  subtitled  "The 
Slavery  Of  Women  In  America."  She 
writes  that  black  slavery  was  an  out- 
growth of  the  slavery  of  women  to 
men.  (I  very  much  agree  with  her.) 
And  she  writes,  "The  white  man 
perpetuated  his  view  of  female  in-

feriority  in  the  institution  of  black 
slavery.  The  value  of  the  black  male 
slave  in  the  marketplace  was  double 
the  value  of  the  black  female  slave."8 
You  will  remember  Sojourner 
Truth's  words  about  working  as  hard 
and  ably  as  any  man.  And  slave 
women  gave  birth  to  additional 
slaves.  Their  worth  to  the  slave 
owner  was  clearly  greater  than  that  of 
male  slaves.  Or  rather,  it  was  so,  but 
it  was  not  allowed  to  be  clear  that  it 
was  so.  Man  does  not  subsist  upon 
bread  alone;  he  subsists  also  upon 
pride.  And  he  has  chosen  to  construct 
his  pride  upon  the  lie  that  men  and 
women  are  very  different  from  one 
another,  and  that  men  are  of  greater 
worth. 

Shulamith  Firestone  has  dared  to 
propose  a  concept  of  dialectical 
materialism  wider  than  the  original 
Marxist  concept— one  that  incor- 
porates an  economic  analysis,  but 
names  the  primary  moving  power 
behind  historical  events,  "the  dialec- 
tic of  sex".  Only  a  woman  could  have 
proposed  this  revision  of  Marx.  And 
most  men  will  find  it  difficult  to 
accept.  For  any  study  of  sexual 
dialectics  will  confront  them  with 
evidence  that  the  pride  which 
sustains  them  is  the  product  of  a 
series  of  lies.  And  these  are  lies  they 
still,  tragically,  experience  as 
necessary. 

They  live  by  the  lie  that  a  man  has 
the  "right"  to  think  of  a  child  as 
"his",  a  woman  as  "his".  We  speak 
of  a  shift  from  "Mother-Right"  to 
"Father-Right",  but  women  never 
claimed  the  "right"  to  children  that 
men  now  claim.  A  child  was  once 
viewed  as  born  to  the  entire  maternal 
clan.  Every  nursing  mother  might 
participate  in  suckling  a  baby.  But 


the  lie  is  now  that  children  belong  to 
their  fathers— or  should  not  exist,  are 
"illegitimate".  And  the  lie  is  that 
those  who  give  birth  to  men  belong  to 
men.  Transparent  lies.  And  yet— in- 
sisted upon.  The  lie  is  that  men  and 
women  are  altogether  different,  one 
from  another.  How  could  it  be 
so— when  the  one  is  made  of  the  very 
flesh  and  blood  of  the  other?  But  it  is 
insisted  upon.  It  is  even  insisted  upon 
that  the  male  is  not  really  born  of  the 
mother.  The  patriarchal  church 
teaches:  everything  really  "pro- 
ceedeth  from  the  Father  and  the 
Son".  Do  not  ask  how.  The  lie  at  the 
very  heart  of  masculine  pride  is  this: 
that  the  mother  is  not  really  the 
mother;  the  mother  is  unnecessary. 

That  we  are  all  born  of  our 
mothers  is  so  obviously  true  that  I 
have  to  keep  reminding  myself  how 
true  it  also  is  that  we  are  taught  to 
deny  it— and  really  do  deny  what  our 
very  bodies  remember  to  be  un- 
deniably so.  "The  one  unifying,  in- 
controvertible experience  shared  by 
all  women  and  men,"  Adrienne  Rich 
names  it  in  "Of  Woman  Born".9  And 
yet  —  this  experience  is  con- 
troverted—stubbornly. Rape  is  an  act 
by  which  men  violently  refuse  to 
remember  that  the  place  they  batter  is 
the  place  that  gave  them  birth. 
Praying  to  "Our  Father"  more  subtly 
erases  memory  of  the  mother.  Under 
patriarchy,  woman  is  acknowledged 
as  wife,  and  as  servant  to  the  child; 
but  we  are  taught  and  taught  to  sup- 
press the  memory  that  we  are  flesh  of 
her  flesh  and  once  literally  lived 
within  her.  Taught  to  suppress  it 
even  though  this  causes  us  to  live  in  a 
state  of  fear. 

A  few  months  ago  I  was  discussing 
feminism   with   a   young   man   who 


Remembering/57 


seemed  to  me  a  man  who  would  be 
open  to  feminist  thought.  But  I  kept 
finding  in  him  strong  resistance  to  it. 
It  slowly  became  clear  that  he  shared 
a  fear  that  affects  very  many  men  — 
the  fear  that  feminists  would  really 
like  to  kill  off  men.  It  occurred  to  me 
to  say,  "There  is  a  lot  of  anger  against 
men  among  us,  but  you  don't  have  to 
be  afraid  that  we  want  to  eliminate 
men.  Don't  forget  that  women  give 
birth  to  men."  I  saw  on  his  face  a 
look  of  utter  astonishment,  and  clear 
relief.  He  had,  I  think,  forgotten  that 
this  is  so. 

Men  have  for  a  long  time  now  tried 
to  live  by  the  lie  that  "man"  is  self- 
made  —  the  mother  not  really  the 
mother.  (The  final  image  in  the  movie 
"Dr.  Strangelove"  has  always 
seemed  to  me  an  inspired  image  of 
this  false  pride:  a  man  straddling  a 
nuclear   bomb   as   it  falls   from   the 


bomb  bay,  whooping  like  a  proud 
cowboy,  feeling  himself  to  be 
altogether  "A  MAN"  now  —  as  he 
blows  from  under  him  the  very  earth 
itself  without  which  he  could  have  no 
being).  The  masculine  identity  is 
built  upon  lies  which  are  sexual  lies. 
And  so  men  will  resist  studying  the 
dialectic  of  sex.  But  as  long  as  this 
dialectic  remains  unexamined,  our 
oppression  will  remain  obscured,  and 
the  means  of  our  release  from  op- 
pression obscured.  Man  will  remain 
master  —  of  a  world  he  is  laying 
waste  beneath  him. 

Firestone  writes  of  Marx  and 
Engels  that  though  they  grounded 
their  theory  in  reality,  it  was  a  partial 
reality.  I  deeply  agree  with  her.  And  I 
believe  it  is  for  women  to  ground  it 
truly  at  last.  By  insisting:  We  are  not 
your  property.  You  have  stolen  us 
from  ourselves.  We  do  not  exist  for

your  pride  to  feed  upon.  We  are  who 
we  are. 

But  suddenly  I  can  hear  your  voice 
—  raised  in  another  objection.  "We 
are  who  we  are,  you  say.  Yet  all  you 
keep  talking  about  is  how  men  deny 
that  the  mother  is  really  the  mother. 
Women  are  not  simply  mothers." 
No,  we  are  not.  I  am  a  woman  who 
has  never  borne  a  child;  and  I  am, 
like  you,  a  lesbian.  So  I  do  really  hear 
your  voice.  But  when  men  claimed 
women  as  their  "rightful"  property, 
and  in  doing  so  denied  that  they  were 
flesh  of  their  mothers'  flesh  —  they  of 
course  stole  from  us  much  more  than 
our  reality  as  childbearers. 

They  stole  from  us,  for  one  thing, 
our  reality  as  creative  workers. 
Because  we  were  considered  their 
property  now,  all  work  we  did  was  to 
be  taken  for  granted;  was  very  often 
not  even  seen  as  work.  It  was  service 
due  them.  In  the  beginning,  Evelyn 
Reed  writes  in  "Women's 
Evolution",  women's  work  was 
supremely  creative.  In  fact,  "it 
created  nothing  less  than  the  human 
species."  We  took  the  lead  in  inven- 
ting agriculture  (primitive  men 
thought  we  possessed  magical 
powers  in  the  growing  of  food,  akin 
to  our  powers  of  growing  children); 
we  took  the  lead  in  domesticating 
animals;  and  in  developing  crafts. 
Reed  notes  that  the  term  for 
"mother"  in  some  primitive 
languages  can  be  translated  as 
"producer-procreatrix".10 

When  men,  moved  by  jealousy, 
laid  claim  to  our  labor  —  both  the 
labor  of  childbirth  and  that  labor 
which  creates  us  as  an  evolving 
species  —  they  stole  from  us,  too,  the 
fullness  of  our  sexual  natures.  We  are 
not    supposed    to    acknowledge    as 


natural  any  feelings,  actions  that  are 
not  in  men's  service.  For  example, 
those  of  us  who  are  mothers  and 
those  of  us  who  are  lesbians  are  sup- 
posed to  feel  that  we  are  utterly 
different  from  one  another.  And  too 
often  we  do  feel  just  as  we  are 
expected  to  —  even  when  one  of  us 
happens  to  be  both  mother  and  les- 
bian. But  before  the  time  of 
patriarchy,  being  a  mother  did  not 
mean  that  one  belonged  to  a  man  — 
had  better  belong  to  a  man;  and  for  a 
woman  to  be  both  a  mother  and  a 
lover  of  other  women  would  have 
been  felt  as  no  contradiction  at  all.  It 
was  surely  experienced  as  quite 
natural  to  move  toward  man  or 
woman  sexually.  If  Reed  is  right 
about  the  cannibalistic  tendencies  of 
the  primitive  male,  and  the  need  felt 
by  women  to  segregate  themselves 
during  the  time  of  pregnancy  and 
suckling,  women  may  well  have  felt 
even  freer  to  relate  sexually  to  other 
women  than  to  men.  Reed  herself, 
though  she  is  often  wonderfully  bold 
about  using  her  own  eyes,  falters 
here,  not  quite  able  to  refuse  the 
patriarchal  view  that  women's 
sexuality  is  for  men  only. Primitive 
women,  she  says,  segregated 
themselves  after  childbirth  for  long 
periods,  even  for  years.  She  puzzles: 
"How  is  it  to  be  explained?  ...  it  is 
highly  unlikely  that  savage  women 
.  .  .  consciously  repressed  their  sexual 
desires."  She  decides:  "The  conclu- 
sion to  be  drawn  is  that  savage 
women  felt  minimal  sexual  desires  or 
perhaps  none  at  all  during  those 
periods."11  It  is  not  a  conclusion  that 
I  draw.  I  conclude  —  wouldn't  you?  — 
that  they  took  other  women  as  their 
lovers. 

Reich,  too,  resists  the  thought  that 


Remembering/59 


we  were  once  this  freely  sexual.  And 
this  leads  him,  too,  to  musings  I 
would  call  fanciful.  In  one  passage, 
he  is  trying  to  guess  at  the  origin  of 
the  taboo  upon  the  genital  embrace 
between  sister  and  brother.  The 
young  men,  he  muses,  had  to  go  off 
hunting  and  live  in  abstinence, 
wandering  about  for  weeks.  When 
they  came  upon  a  strange  tribe  they 
"would  seize  what  the  peaceful  tribe 
had  gathered  ...  in  order  to  embrace 
them,  to  which  they  were  especially 
incited  by  their  abstinence.  If  they 
emerged  victorious,  it  was  easy  to 
enslave  the  vanquished  men,  to 
prohibit  them  the  genital  embrace 
with  their  own  sister-wives."12  Engels 
writes  that  before  patriarchy  slavery 
did  not  exist,  and  Reich  tends  to 
agree  with  what  Engels  writes,  so  I 
was  surprised  to  see  him  take  it  for 
granted  that  the  men  would  be  quick 
to  enslave  the  others.  And  I  was  sur- 
prised to  see  him  assume  that  they 
lived  in  sexual  abstinence  during 
their  hunting  trips.  /  assume  that 
they  took  one  another  as  lovers. 

How  can  I  feel  so  sure  of  this, 
when  both  Reed  and  Reich,  who 
would  disagree,  are  learned  about 
prehistory  and  I  am  not?  There  is  a 
saying,  "The  history  of  the  in- 
dividual repeats  the  history  of  the 
race."  Very  many  men  and  women 
could  tell  of  coming  to  recognize  that 
they  had  really  always  been  as  in- 
clined to  desire  those  of  their  own  sex 
as  those  of  the  so-called  "opposite" 
sex,  but  had  been  taught  to  refuse  to 
allow  themselves  to  "experience  their 
own  experience".  (The  phrase  is 
Mary  Daly's).  Under  patriarchy,  we 
are  not  supposed  to  belong  to 
ourselves.  We  are  supposed  to 
"know"  that  we  belong  to  men.  (And 


men  who  desire  other  men  are  sup- 
posed to  "know"  that  their 
"manhood"  requires  our  subjection). 

Which  brings  me  full  circle  in  my 
response  to  the  objection  that  women 
are  not  simply  mothers.  No,  we  are 
not  simply  mothers.  But  the  very  act 
by  which  men  try  to  take  possession 
of  us,  and  to  pretend  that  our  sexuali- 
ty is  there  for  men  only  —  and  so 
brand  lesbians  as  outlaws;  this  same 
act  is  the  act  by  which  they  try  to  pre- 
tend that  mothers  are  not  really 
mothers.  I  wrote  that  in  the  act  of 
rape  men  refuse  to  remember  that  the 
place  they  batter  is  the  place  that 
gave  them  birth.  But  I  could  well 
have  added  that  in  the  act  of  "making 
love"  men  are  supposed  to  refuse  to 
remember  this,  too.  Ellen  Moers,  in  the 
last  chapter  of  "Literary  Women", 
noting  that  all  the  terms  for  women's 
sex  have  been  fabricated  by  the  male 
mind,  comments  upon  the  term 
"vagina".  The  word  is  Latin  for 
sheath  or  scabbard.  The  mind  that 
chose  it  chose  to  disregard  the  fact 
that  "as  passageway  to  life  for  the 
newborn  infant,  the  canal  walls 
miraculously  stretch."  The  word  dic- 
tates that  we  think  of  that 
passageway  as  "a  tight  receptacle  for 
the  male  organ,  visualized  as  a 
sword."13  The  choice  of  this  one  word 
exposes  the  lie  by  which  the  artifical 
self  known  as  "man"  has  been 
produced.  A  lie  that  is  murderous  — 
as  the  word's  evocation  of  a  sword 
thrust  into  a  woman's  body  concedes. 
A  lie  that  has  robbed  both  women 
and  men  of  our  true  sexuality. 

Our  earliest  sensual  feelings  are 
feelings  that  we  have  as  infants 
toward  our  mothers.  And  these  are 
feelings  which  must  contain  actual 
memories  —  not  mental,  perhaps,  but 


60/Quest 


bodily  memories  —  of  dwelling 
within  her  body,  and  at  peace  with 
her;  aware  of  our  own  heartbeat  but 
also  of  hers;  aware  of  the  life  within 
us,  but  aware,  too,  of  life  not  ours 
with  which  we  are  intimately  linked. 
As  a  baby  suckles,  it  must  drink  these 
memories  with  its  mother's  milk. 
And  these  are  memories  that  are  the 
same  for  us  whether  we  are  female  or 
male.  I  have  come  to  believe  that,  for 
all  of  us,  women  and  men,  this 
earliest  sense  experience  is  the  only 
natural  source  for  later  sexual 
feelings:  the  experience  of 
remembering,  as  we  touch  or  are 
touched,  that  we  are  our  own  self  but 
not  this  self  alone;  a  single  life  but 
also  life  beyond  our  life.  The  bodily 
memory  of  this  literal  fact  not 
rejected  but  recollected  and 
recollected,  and  as  it  were  mused 
upon  without  words  —  this  is  what 
natural  sexuality  would  be.  Not  the 
illusion  of  proudly  "taking",  or  of 
being  taken  by,  one  who  is  one's  "op- 
posite". A  rejoicing  in  the  fact  that 
(whatever  our  gender)  we  are  kin- 
dred, linked  to  one  another  and  to  all 
of  nature.  I  don't  mean  that  the  rela- 
tion of  an  infant  to  its  mother  should 
be  a  model  for  an  adult  relation.  For 
the  infant  is  altogether  dependent.  I 
mean  very  simply  that  the  child's 
very  body  remembers  truths  which 
we  later  repress  at  our  peril  And 
patriarchy  has  insisted  that  we 
repress  them.  Adrienne  Rich  writes 
in  "Of  Woman  Born",  "Perhaps  all 
sexual  or  intimate  physical  contact 
brings  us  back  to  that  first  body."14 
Would  that  it  did.  Our  illness  is  that 
we  do  not  allow  it. 

In  the  ancient  myth  in  which 
Persephone  is  stolen  from  Demeter, 
her  mother,  the  result  is  winter.  We 


have  all  of  us  been  stolen  from  our 
mothers.  Patriarchy  is  our  long 
winter.  And  perhaps  our  first  task  is 
simply  to  recover  those  memories 
which  were  rapt  from  us  when  we 
were  claimed  by  the  patriarchs. 
Robin  Morgan,  in  her  poem  "The 
Network  Of  The  Imaginary 
Mother",  in  which  she,  too,  tries  to 
imagine  our  true  natures,  asks, 
"What  do  you  remember?  What  is  it 
that  you  long  for  still?"15  I  think  she 
asks  the  crucial  question.  It  is  a  ques- 
tion we  must  learn  to  put  not  simply 
to  our  intellects  but  to  our  very 
bodies.  For  the  lies  by  which  the 
patriarchs  produce  themselves  are 
very  specifically  lies  about  our 
bodies.  The  actual  physical  assaults 
—  the  rapes,  the  batterings  which  we 
have  had  to  endure  from  them  —  are 
logical  extensions  of  their  attempt  to 
deny  in  imagination  that  they  are 
born  of  our  bodies'  labor,  not  of  their 
masterful  own  selves.  The  memory 
that  they  violently  repress  —  the 
memory  of  dwelling  within  our 
mothers  —  teaches  that  we  are  kin- 
dred. If  our  sexuality  were  allowed  to 
be  natural,  each  movement  of  desire 
would  stir  that  memory,  reaffirm  that 
truth.  The  repression  of  that  memory 
divides  us  from  one  another. 

Engels  writes  that  class  oppression 
is  the  result  of  division  of  labor.  I 
think  it  more  accurate  to  say  that  it  is 
the  result  of  a  supposed  division  of 
our  natures.  He  writes,  with  Marx, 
that  the  first  division  of  labor  was 
that  between  men  and  women  for 
child  breeding.  There  are  very  many 
divisions  of  labor  that  have  distorted 
human  lives;  but  that  first  division  of 
labor  happens  to  be  natural.  (I  am 
assuming  that  by  the  term  "child 
breeding"    he    means    simply    that, 


Remembering/61 


and  not  also  the  rearing  of  children). 
If  this  were  indeed  the  inevitable 
source  of  class  oppression,  the  out- 
look for  an  end  to  oppression  would 
be  bleak.  It  isn't  because  the  breeding 
of  children  involves  unequal  labor; 
it's  because  men  once  did  not  know 
that  they  played  any  part  in  it  at  all, 
experiencing  the  difference  between 
us  as  a  division  not  of  labor  but  of 
fundamental  being  —  it's  because  of 
this,  my  guess  is,  that  they  tried  to 
annex  us  to  themselves,  and  oppres- 
sion began  here.  Because,  in  their  ig- 
norance, they  felt  themselves  to  be 
essentially  different  —  not  quite  flesh 
of  their  mothers'  flesh,  after  all,  less 
than  us,  they  tried  to  distort  the 
"difference"  that  was  a  cause  of 
humiliation  into  a  "difference"  on 
which  their  pride  could  feed;  chose  to 
assert:  "Women  are  less  than  men; 
for  they  are  at  our  service".  The  will 
to  negate  the  selfhood  of  others,  to 
turn  others  into  slaves,  began  here. 
(Engels  writes  that  the  first  class  op- 
pression coincides  with  the  oppres- 
sion of  woman  by  man.  I  would  say 
that  he  avoids  stating  the  obvious: 
that  the  first  class  oppression  is  this 
oppression.) 

Divisions  of  labor  can  be  natural. 
The  "first  division  of  labor"  is.  And 
Engels  himself  says  that  at  certain 
times  other  divisions  of  labor  are 
natural,  in  the  sense  of  necessary.  He 
adds  that  they  are  perpetuated  by 
violence  and  fraud  after  they  have 
stopped  being  necessary.  This 
happens,  I  would  say,  because  men 
persist  in  asserting  that  there  is  a 
division  of  being  that  is  natural  —  the 
division  between  "men"  and 
"women":  "masters"  ("misters") 
whose  lives  are  real  lives,  and  those 
others  whose  lives  are  real  only  as  we 


help  them  to  become  what  they  wish 
to  be.  Divisions  of  labor  are 
sometimes  natural;  but  the  division 
of  being  is  never  natural.  And  I 
would  name  the  attempt  to  assert  that 
it  is  natural  the  continuing  source  of 
class  oppression  —  and  the  source  of 
all  divisions  of  labor  that  do  distort 
our  lives.  Engels  writes  that  the  early 
communal  society  was  burst  asunder 
by  the  division  of  labor.  It  was  burst 
asunder,  /  would  say,  by  the  denial 
that  we  are  of  one  nature. 

Reed  describes  how  in  the  maternal 
gens  soon  after  a  child's  birth,  the 
women  would  sit  in  a  circle  and  the 
child  would  be  passed  around  the  cir- 
cle, each  woman  holding  it  for  a 
while.  The  child  would  then  have 
been  born  to  the  clan  —  whether  girl 
child  or  boy  child,  one  of  them  now, 
nobody's  possession,  but  simply  kin 
to  all.  We  cannot  turn  the  clock  back 
to  matriarchy.  And  I  would  not  want 
to.  Clearly  enough  there  was  not  the 
fullness  of  equity  at  that  time.  Men 
did  not  sit  in  that  circle;  did  not  know 
how  like  they  were  to  women,  how 
altogether  kin  we  are.  But  I  do  agree 
with  Morgan  (and  Engels)  that  the 
truly  equitable  society  would  be  a 
revival  of  that  ancient  society  in  a 
higher  form.  For  the  beauty  of  the 
maternal  gens  was  that  there  were  no 
owners,  no  owned. 

What  is  the  revolution  that  we 
need?  I  would  say:  We  need  to  dis- 
solve the  lie  that  some  people  have  a 
right  to  think  of  other  people  as  their 
property.  And  we  need  at  last  to  form 
—  as  welcome  to  our  children  —  a  cir- 
cle that  includes  us  all,  [in  which  all 
of  us  are  seen  as  equal.]  How  do  we 
learn  to  do  that? 

I  think  that  we  have  to  begin  by 
trying  to  form  again  a  kinship  circle

that  is  simply  a  circle  of  women  and 
of  children.  I  don't  think  that  we  can 
form  that  necessary  larger  circle, 
which  includes  men,  until  we  have 
found  our  courage  to  assert  with 
great  clarity  (and  of  course  with  more 
than  words)  that  we  do  not  belong  to 
men.  If  only  the  men  who  felt  un- 
equal in  that  ancient  society  had 
known  to  alter  it  by  insisting,  "We, 
too,  should  be  in  the  circle  that 
welcomes  the  newborn".  If  only  they 
had  known  that  they  could  insist,  "We 
are  not  that  different  from  you."  But 


they  altered  their  situation  by 
bursting  the  circle  asunder.  By 
teaching  each  child:  "You  belong  to 
me" .  And  by  forcibly  teaching  each 
woman:  "You  do  not  belong  among 
your  sisters;  you  belong  to  me."  So 
we  have  to  learn  first  to  assert:  "We 
do  not  belong  to  you.  We  are  who  we 


are. 


And  to  truly  learn  who  we  are,  we 
have  to  turn  to  one  another  again. 
We  do  not  belong  to  others,  but  our 
lives  are  linked;  we  belong  in  a  circle 
of  others.  We  learn  best  to  listen  to

our  own  voices  if  we  are  listening  at 
the  same  time  to  other  women  — 
whose  stories,  however  different  we 
are,  turn  out,  if  we  listen  well,  to  be 
our  stories  too.  Their  anger,  which 
they  begin  to  acknowledge,  we 
recognize  as  our  anger;  the  strength 
which  they  have  doubted,  but  which 
that  anger  hints  at,  is  our  strength, 
too. 

In  the  early  days  of  this  second 
wave  of  the  feminist  struggle,  many 
women  who  had  never  before  really 
listened  to  other  women  began  to 
listen  —  formally  and  informally,  in 
planned  consciousness-raising 
sessions  and  spontaneously;  to  listen 
to  friends,  to  strangers,  to 
themselves;  seeming,  often,  to  hear 
themselves  as  other  women  spoke. 
And  talking  with  one  another  at  last, 
more  and  more  of  us  began  to  dare  to 
believe  that  we  can  decide  for 
ourselves  who  we  are;  we  don't  need 
to  look  to  men  to  define  us.  We 
belong  to  ourselves  —  we  began  to 
dare  to  remember  this. 

Jung  writes  that  there  are 
memories  which  belong  not  to  any 
individual  but  to  the  race.  And  it  may 
be  so.  Perhaps  as  we  sat  together  in 
these  new  circles  of  women, 
remembering  together  who  we  were, 
we  began  even  to  remember  the  long- 
ago  —  to  remember,  with  that  part  of 
the  brain  which  is  nonverbal,  not 
only  our  individual  earliest 
experience  (of  drawing  life  itself  from 
a  woman),  but  also  the  earliest 
experience  of  the  race  —  .  an 
experience,  too,  of  knowing  well 
women's  power. 

I  don't  mean  that  this  kind  of 
remembering  was  the  subject  of  our 
talk.  Our  talk  was  above  all  about  our 
present  slavery.   I  mean  that  as  we 


spoke  together  of  our  slave  state  — 
daring  to  name  it  that,  daring  to  trust 
ourselves  to  one  another  as  we 
described  our  lives  —  we  may  well 
have  begun  to  recover  those 
strengthening  memories  without 
even  knowing  them  for  what  they 
were. 

Whether  or  not  you  give  any 
credence  to  race  memories,  we  did  at 
any  rate  trust  ourselves  to  one 
another,  and  we  did  begin  to  feel  our 
strength.  It  was  declared  that 
"sisterhood  is  powerful".  And  for  a 
while  everyone  assented.  In  the  early 
days  of  our  struggle,  when  those 
words  were  popular,  very  many 
women  had  the  feeling  that  we 
couldn't  be  stopped;  tasted,  at  least, 
that  feeling  —  that  more  and  more  of 
us  were  waking  up;  that  we  were 
more  than  half  the  human  race  (the 
other  less-than-half  unable  to  func- 
tion without  us,  though  they  tried  to 
pretend  that  they  could;  just  let  us  go 
on  strike!);  and  now  that  we  had 
recognized  one  another  as  sisters,  we 
could  communicate  with  one  another 
so  swiftly,  almost  wordlessly  —  often 
upon  first  meeting  —  that  we  couldn't 
lose  our  struggle;  we  might  even  win 
it  very  soon.  Carol  Hanisch  of 
Redstockings  has  written  (in 
"Feminist  Revolution"),  "We 
thought  it  would  only  be  a  matter  of  a 
few  years  before  we  would  have  male 
supremacy  conquered."16  Very  many 
women  had  at  least  a  taste  of  feeling 
that. 

But  then  —  many  women  had 
another  experience  that  followed 
upon  this,  painfully.  The  magic 
seemed  to  fail.  Communication 
wasn't  that  easy.  The  differences 
between  us  began  to  seem  terribly 
real.  Lesbians  began  saying  that  they 


64/Quest 


couldn't  talk  with  "straight"  women; 
"straight"  women  began  saying  that 
they  couldn't  talk  with  lesbians. 
Many  women  began  to  feel  that  class 
differences  divided  us.  Few  of  us  any 
longer  enjoyed  that  luxurious  feeling 
that  we  were  sure  to  win,  perhaps 
even  soon.  "In  retrospect/'  Hanisch 
wrote,  the  idea  sounded  "a  little  naive 
—  silly  almost." 

Naive  it  was,  of  all  of  us,  not  to  an- 
ticipate how  easily  we  could  be 
splintered.  But  I  don't  think  that  the 
idea  was  silly.  I  think  that  our 
experience  of  optimism  is  one  that  we 
should  be  careful  not  to  forget.  If 
enough  of  us  were  able  to  hold 
steadily  to  certain  truths,  we  could 
end  male  supremacy  swiftly.  And 
when  we  tasted  that  optimism  I  think 
that  we  were  in  touch  with  those 
truths.  But  we  didn't  fully  know 
what  it  was  that  we  knew.  And  so  we 
could  too  easily  be  frightened  into 
doubting  that  we  knew  it. 

I  think  I  can  hear  your  voice: 
"This  is  precisely  why  we  need  the 
discipline  of  dialectics."  But  I  have  to 
respond:  My  anxiety  is  that  if  women 
adopt  the  method  of  dialectics  as  it  is 
now  taught,  it  will  not  help  them  to 
grasp  the  truths  I  am  talking  about.  It 
will  distract  them  from  these  truths.  I 
think  that  this  already  has  been 
happening.  The  method  of  dialectics 
puts  great  stress  upon  the  need  to 
identify  the  contradictions  in  a  situa- 
tion. I  think  that  under  the  influence 
of  Marxist  thinking,  in  awe  of  it, 
women  have  sought  to  name  the  con- 
tradictions, in  our  situation,  and  [in 
this  very  process]  have  surrendered 
our  strength  —  calling  into  question 
that  assumption  of  commonality 
among  us  which  we  had  begun  to 
dare  to  make,  and  which  is  just  what 


was  putting  us  in  touch  with  our 
strength. 

I  do  not  mean  that  I  think  the 
theory  of  contradictions  is  a  useless 
theory  —  the  idea  that  "there  is  inter- 
nal contradiction  in  every  single 
thing,  hence  its  motion  and 
development"  (the  words  are  Mao's); 
the  idea  that  we  should  "analyze  the 
movement  of  opposition  of  different 
things  and  on  the  basis  of  such 
analysis"  find  the  appropriate 
revolutionary  method  —  a  method  for 
resolving  the  contradictions.  I  think 
it  can  be  very  clarifying  to  think  in 
these  terms.  But  I  also  think  that 
when  it  is  the  feminist  revolution  that 
we  are  concerned  to  make,  we  have  to 
be  very  careful  to  use  our  own  eyes, 
make  our  own  analysis.  In  "On  Con- 
tradiction", Mao  makes  the  point 
that  we  must  give  especial  attention 
"to  the  distinction  between  the  prin- 
cipal contradiction  and  the  non- 
principal  contradictions  .  .  . 
Otherwise  we  shall  make  mistakes." 
In  any  process,  he  says,  "there  is  only 
one  principal  contradiction  .  .  .  Once 
this  principal  contradiction  is 
grasped,  all  problems  can  be  readily 
solved."  I  have  suggested  already 
what  seems  to  me  to  be  the  principal 
contradiction  in  all  our  lives.  That  is 
the  contradiction  between  the  lie  men 
try  to  live,  and  try  to  make  all  of  us 
live  —  the  lie  that  men  and  women  are 
of  essentially  different  natures  —  and 
the  truth  that  we  are  of  one  nature.  If 
we  do  grasp  this  as  the  principal  con- 
tradiction we  have  to  resolve,  then 
what  Marxists  up  until  now  have 
spoken  of  as  principal  contradictions 
become  non-principal  contradictions, 
and  everything  shifts. 

The  Redstockings  pamphlet, 
"Feminist    Revolution",    contains    a 


Remembering/65 


quotation  from  the  Webster's 
Collegiate  Dictionary:  "PROLETARY. 
L.  proletarius,  fr  proles  offspring.  In 
ancient  Rome,  a  citizen  of  the  lowest 
class,  without  property  and  regarded 
as  capable  of  serving  the  state  only 
by  having  children."  And  then  it 
quotes  Catherine  Henry:  "the  word 
'proletariat'  (from  the  French)  means 
'those  who  breed'.  In  fact,  proletarian 
women  are  the  proletariat  in  the 
proletariat."19 

But  this  is  what  I  mean  about 
having  to  be  very  careful  to  use  oui 
own  eyes.  In  fact  —  look  at  the  root  of 
the  word  —  women  are  the 
proletariat;  those  who  breed  are  the 
proletariat.  The  proletariat  which  is 
women  (all  women)  —  the  original 
proletariat  —  cannot  be  said  to  be 
contained  within  the  proletariat  as 
Marxists  have  defined  it.  The  one 
concept  cracks  the  other  concept 
wide  open. 

And  this  is  what  I  mean  when  I  say 
that  I  worry  about  our  being  too 
much  in  awe  of  Marxist  thinking. 
Catherine  Henry  looks  at  the  words 
"those  who  breed"  —  but  doesn't 
trust  herself  to  write  "Women  are  the 
proletariat."  Until  we  dare  to  write 
"Women  —  all  women  —  are  the 
proletariat",  I  am  afraid  that  we  will 
remain  the  underclass  that  we  are. 
We  will  remain  splintered  —  divided 
from  one  another.  And  we  will  fail  to 
make  the  revolution. 

What  I  have  just  said,  I  know,  is 
shocking.  To  accept  this  new  defini- 
tion of  the  proletariat,  we  would  have 
to  look  at  everything  differently.  I 
think  that  we  do  have  to  look  at 
everything  differently. 

You  will  ask:  Do  I  think,  then,  that 
when  Marxists  define  class  struggle 
as  they  do  they  are  not  describing 


reality?  I  think  that  they  are 
describing  reality.  But  a  partial  reali- 
ty. I  would  say  that  they  are 
describing  the  struggle  of  men  who 
refuse  to  be  the  property  of  others. 
And  they  are  describing  the  struggle 
of  women  in  so  far  as  it  coincides 
with  the  struggle  of  men.  But  I'll 
repeat:  the  struggle  of  women  cannot 
be  said  to  be  contained  within  that 
struggle.  The  most  oppressed 
laboring  man  can  go  home  to  "his" 
woman  and  show  her  who's  "the 
man".  The  most  privileged  woman 
can  walk  down  the  street  and  be 
taught  that  lesson  by  a  whistle. 
Engels  himself  wrote  that  the  wife  is 
the  proletariat,  the  husband  the 
bourgeousie.  But  then  he  forgot  that 
he  had  seen  this.  I  am  daring  to  say 
that  the  class  struggle  as  Marxists 
have  described  it  is  a  struggle  to 
resolve  a  contradiction  less  fun- 
damental than  the  contradiction  the 
feminist  struggle  can  resolve.  I  know 
this  is  heresay.  It's  the  man's  game 
that  is  supposed  to  matter.  There  was 
a  piece  in  the  February  6th  New  York 
Times  magazine  section  called  "The 
Clubs  Griffin  Bell  Had  to  Quit".  It 
reported  that  in  one  of  these  men's 
clubs,  wives  and  children  of  members 
are  given  privileges;  but  "should  a 
group  of  men  wish  to  use  a  tennis 
court  on  which  women  are  playing, 
the  men  simply  step  onto  the  court, 
say  'Thank  you  very  much,  ladies,' 
and  the  women  depart."  I  think  that 
most  radical  men  take  a  very  com- 
parable attitude  toward  women 
engaged  in  making  revolution.  And  I 
think  it  is  time  that  women  refused  to 
get  off  the  court. 

I  will  probably  be  accused  not  only 
of  heresay  but  of  introducing  im- 
possible confusion.  If  I  say  that  the 


66/Quest 


class  oppression  Marxists  have 
defined  is  a  reality,  but  that  the  op- 
pression of  all  women  by  men  must 
be  seen  as  a  reality  more  fundamental 
(the  reality  from  which  all  other  op- 
pression derives)  —  how  can  one  any 
longer  make  neat  distinctions 
between  oppressors  and  oppressed? 
Won't  it  often  happen  that  we  would 
have  to  name  the  very  same  person 
both  an  oppressed  person  and  an  op- 
pressor? Yes,  it  will  very  often 
happen.  Life  is  precisely  that  com- 
plicated. And  to  pretend  that  it  isn't 
that  complicated  doesn't  help.  We 
need  rescue  from  neat  distinctions 
that  are  illusions.  Patriarchy  is 
founded  upon  them. 

If    we    can't    distinguish    tidily 
between   oppressor    and    oppressed, 


how  can  we  wage  battle  —  without 
destroying  comrades  as  we  strike  at 
enemies?  I  think  this  is  a  question 
that  troubles  very  many  women, 
whether  or  not  they  have  put  it  to 
themselves  as  a  conscious  question. 
And  the  answer  that  can  be  given  has 
been  obscured,  again,  by  the  fact  that 
many  of  us  are  hypnotized  by  the 
already  existing  tradition  of  Marxist 
struggle.  If  our  struggle  against 
patriarchal  oppression  were  simply  to 
imitate  the  forms  that  class  struggle 
has  taken  so  far  —  the  battle  scene 
would  be  a  scene  of  confusion.  And 
I'd  suggest  that  this  is  one  reason  so 
many  women  still  hang  back  from 
battle.  But  Mao  has  again  written 
something  that  is  relevant.  He  says, 
"the  methods  of  resolving  contradic-

tions,  differ  according  to  the 
difference  in  the  nature  of  the  con- 
tradictions." If  the  fundamental  con- 
tradiction to  be  resolved  is,  as  I  think 
it  is,  the  contradiction  between  the  lie 
that  men  and  women  are  of  different 
natures  and  the  truth  that  we  are  of 
one  nature;  the  lie  that  humankind 
can  be  termed  "mankind",  for 
woman  is  The  Other,  and  the  truth 
that  no  human  being  should  be 
thought  of  as  The  Other  —  then  the 
appropriate  form  of  struggle  is  surely 
that  form  still  largely  to  be  invented: 
nonviolent  struggle.  One  can't  prove 
a  common  nature  with  others  by 
doing  violence  to  them.  And  again:  if 
the  complicated  truth  is  that  many 
oppressors  are  also  oppressed  —  non- 
violent confrontation  is  the  only  con- 
frontation that  allows  us  to  respond 
realistically  to  such  complexity.  In 
this  form  of  struggle  we  address 
ourselves  both  to  that  which  we 
refuse  to  accept  from  others  and  that 
which  we  have  in  common  with  them 

—  however  much  or  little  that  may 
be. 

I  know  that  you  have  declared 
your  belief  in  armed  struggle.  And  I 
imagine  that  you  see  nonviolent 
struggle  as  essentially  passive  —  a 
form  of  appeal,  rather  than  a  form  of 
struggle.  Just  the  behavior  the 
patriarchs  would  like  to  have  us 
adopt  —  very  ladylike,  and  ineffec- 
tual. But  the  strike  is  not  a  passive 
form  of  behavior.  It  has  a  power  that 
I  don't  think  you  will  deny.  And  to 
struggle  nonviolently  is  to  go  on 
strike.  If  enough  women  ever  really 
went  on  strike  —  refusing  the  roles 
that  have  been  assigned  to  us,  in- 
sisting on  roles  of  our  own  choosing 

—  everything,  everything  would  have 
to  change. 


To  struggle  nonviolently  is  also,  of 
course,  to  refuse  to  reply  in  kind 
when  there  is  retaliation.  This  is  what 
is  seen  as  passive.  But  it  can  be  a  much 
more  passive,  much  more  desperate 
act  to  reply  in  kind  —  to  accept  as 
one's  own  the  oppressor's  vision  that 
there  is  nothing  at  all  to  prevent  us 
from  trying  to  destroy  one  another. 

In  nonviolent  struggle,  we  seek  to 
hold  in  mind  both  contradiction  and 
commonality.  We  refuse  to  cooperate 
with  that  which  is  in  contradiction  to 
our  deep  needs;  and  we  speak  to  that 
commonality  linking  us  all,  which,  if 
remembered,  can  inhibit  the  impulse 
to  destroy.  A  nonviolent  dialectic  — 
that  is  the  dialectic  that  I  do  think  ac- 
cords with  feminism,  and  that  we 
must  try  to  invent.  We  will  be  called 
violent,  of  course.  For  though  I 
would  define  our  struggle  with  men 
as  an  insistence  upon  the  fact  that 
women  and  men  are  alike  in  nature  — 
ironically,  the  very  attempt  to  insist 
upon  this  will  lead  again  and  again  to 
our  having  to  adopt  a  temporary 
separatism.  If  men  refuse  to  relate  to 
us  in  any  but  the  old  ways,  our  only 
means  of  making  our  point  is  often  to 
refuse,  until  they  change,  to  relate  to 
them  at  all.  And  there  are  many  men 
who  will  interpret  this  as  our  wishing 
them  dead.  There  are  many  men  on 
the  Left  who  will  interpret  it  in  this 
way.  Which  complicates  our  making 
alliances  with  them  —  even  when  such 
alliances,  if  possible,  would  gain 
much  for  all  of  us. 

I  think  we  have  to  beware  of 
naming  the  alliances  more  urgent 
than  the  feminist  struggle.  I  think 
that  the  most  urgent  action  for  us  to 
take  is  that  of  forming  a  strong 
kinship  circle  of  women.  Once 
enough  of  us  are  firm  in  our  refusal 


68/Quest 


to  be  treated  by  men  as  their  proper- 
ty, men  will  begin  to  relate  to  us  in 
another  way.  But  most  of  us  will  find 
only  the  courage  to  refuse  the  old,  the 
demeaning  relation,  if  we  have  the 
company  of  other  women.  In  the  old 
relation,  we  allow  men  to  define  us. 
And  though  the  definition  that  they 
give  us  grotesquely  constricts  us,  it 
does  give  us  a  place  in  the  world  as  it 
is.  A  narrow  place.  But  we  know  that 
place.  We  have  —  if  we  behave 
ourselves  —  the  security  of  the 
beloved  house  slave.  To  refuse  that 
place  is  to  step  into  the  unknown.  We 
risk  doubting  that  we  live  anywhere 
at  all.  It  has  been  so  many  centuries 
since  we  were  our  own  women. 

What  I  have  just  written  falls  short 
of  describing  women's  situation.  It  is 
not  simply  that,  like  other  servants, 
we  are  taught  to  know  our  place,  to 
pay  attention  to  the  wishes  of  the 
master  and  learn  to  keep  our  own 
feelings  to  ourselves.  Other  servants 
lead  double  lives  —  the  lives  of  their 
masters  and  (though  there's  little 
enough  time  for  it)  their  own.  But  we 
are  taught  from  childhood  on  that  a 
woman's  fulfilment  is  to  utterly 
merge  her  life  with  that  of  the  man 
who  chooses  her  to  be  his  (or  with 
that  of  the  son  she  bears  him;  or  even 
with  the  boss  who  hires  her);  taught 
that  we  only  become  our  true  selves, 
"true  women",  when  we  surrender 
our  selves  in  this  way.  If  we  rebel,  it 
is  not  only  that  we  risk  doubting  that 
we  any  longer  have  our  place  in  the 
world;  we  risk  doubting  that  we  have 
any  identity  at  all. 

This  is  why  I  would  call  the  re- 
discovery of  sisterhood  our  most 
urgent  task.  In  one  another's  com- 
pany, we  begin  to  dare  to  believe  that 
we  belong  to  nobody  and  can  create 


ourselves.  We  begin  to  dare  to  refuse 
the  lies  the  masters  have  expected  us 
to  live  by,  and  to  listen  to  the  truths 
our  own  experience  contains.  The 
experience  of  our  sisters  confirms 
ours.  We  begin  to  dare  to  presume  to 
trust  our  own  eyes. 

But  this  trust  in  ourselves  is  ten- 
tative. To  feel  it  —  to  feel  it  sometimes 
very  strongly  —  is  such  a  new 
experience  for  us  that  we  can  think  it 
reliable.  But  it  easily  fails  us.  And 
nothing  can  more  quickly  cause  it  to 
evaporate  than  harsh  judgments 
upon  us  made  by  other  women. 

I  can  remember  still  my  feelings 
two  years  ago  when  I  read  an 
editorial  in  "Off  Our  Backs"  which 
warned  that  we  had  better  learn  to 
make  harsh  judgments  —  warned  of 
our  "having  to  be  careful  about  who 
we  called  'sister'  ".  I  can  remember 
still  the  constriction  in  the  pit  of  my 
stomach  as  I  read  those  words.  The 
constriction  was  sudden  terror. 
Terror  for  the  women's  movement. 
And  for  myself.  Within  this  move- 
ment I  had  begun  for  the  first  time  in 
my  life  to  feel  that  I  was  allowed  to  be 
openly  just  the  person  I  really  was;  to 
decide  for  myself  who  I  was;  and  to 
act  upon  this.  I  had  felt  encouraged 
to  believe  that  to  take  this  extraor- 
dinary freedom  —  in  the  company  of 
other  women  —  was  in  fact  to  make 
the  revolution.  But  this  freedom  was 
being  taken  away  again.  I  had  to  fear 
again  —  we  all  had  to  fear  —  being 
labelled,  being  found  unfit.  I  think  a 
great  many  women  experienced  this 
shock.  I  don't  mean  upon  reading  the 
editorial  in  "Off  Our  Backs".  But 
each  in  her  own  way  first  experienced 
sisterhood,  and  then  the  sudden  fear 
that  she  could  be  told  that  she  was 
not  a  sister.  The  fear  that  she  had

better  stop  trying  to  use  her  own  eyes 
and  instead  try  to  make  sure  of 
saying  or  doing  what  a  sister 
"should"  say  or  do.  I  think  as  more 
and  more  of  us  received  this  shock, 
we  began  to  lose  our  collective 
strength. 

And  I  think  that  the  influence 
upon  us  of  Marxist  thinking  had 
much  to  do  with  this  —  the  tradition 
that  says  we  must  be  careful  to  give 
just  the  name  it  deserves  to  every 
differing  tendency  among  us.  I  don't 
mean  to  say  that  there  are  not  very 
real  differences  among  us.  And  I 
don't  mean  to  say  that  I  think  we 
should  overlook  them.  I  think  it  is 
very  very  necessary  to  learn  from  one 
another  under  what  varying  con- 
ditions we  live  our  slave  lives.  If  we 
don't  learn  this,  we  will  constantly  be 
hurting  one  another  —  failing  to  im- 


agine the  specific  difficulties  that  face 
us  in  one  condition  or  another;  the 
specific  fears  that  make  it  hard  to 
take  the  actions  that  can  free  us.  But 
the  longer  we  listen  to  one  another  — 
with  real  attention  —the  more  com- 
monality we  will  find.  That  is,  if  we 
are  careful  to  exchange  with  one 
another  life  stories  and  not  simply 
opinions.  If  we  adopt  the  mode  that  is 
now  traditional  for  consciousness- 
raising:  take  turns  speaking,  speak 
from  experience,  don't  interrupt,  and 
don't  deliver  judgments  upon  one 
another.  This  mode  of  relating  can 
work  a  kind  of  magic. 

I  think  of  the  split  between 
lesbians  and  heterosexual  women. 
Each  group  has  felt  that  it  was  op- 
pressed by  the  other;  felt  on  many 
painful  occasions  that  the  other 
would   like   to   exclude   it  from  the 


70/Quest 


revolution.  And  yet  when  women 
from  both  groups  have  dared  to 
believe  in  the  possibility  that  —  by 
listening  to  one  another  —  they  could 
find  common  ground,  they  have 
found  that  ground.  I  used  to  especial- 
ly seek  out  lesbian  groups  at 
women's  conferences.  Now  I  often 
don't  bother.  I  know  now  that  a 
woman  who  is  not  a  lesbian  can  learn 
to  identify  with  me  not  simply  by 
listening  to  me  as  I  tell  of  my  life,  but 
by  listening  to  her  own  self  as  she  is 
telling  me  of  hers.  If,  say,  she  is  the 
mother  of  a  daughter,  and  allows 
herself  to  recall  freely  how  she  felt 
toward  her  daughter  as  an  infant,  she 
may  recall  that  those  feelings  were 
clearly  sexual;  and  as  she  recalls  this, 
may  recognise  herself  in  me.  I  will,  as 
often,  recognize  myself  in  her.  If  she 
tells  me,  say,  of  feeling  like  a  failed 
woman  upon  hearing  that  her  hus- 
band has  been  unfaithful,  I,  who 
have  never  had  a  husband,  will 
recognize  that  I  have  known  the  very 
feeling  she  reports  —  every  time  a 
man's  glance  has  labelled  me  one  who 
does  not  answer  to  his  needs,  a 
"queer".  (I  have  known  better  than 
to  feel  a  failed  woman  at  such 
moments,  but  —  a  slave  still  —  have 
felt  it  in  spite  of  myself,  to  my  rage). 
Class  differences  are  the 
differences  that  have  made  it  most 
difficult  for  us  to  identify  with  one 
another.  Here  we  have  felt  most  hyp- 
notised by  the  Marxist  analysis  — 
fearful  to  commit  the  act  of  faith  that 
there  is  commonality  among  us;  fear- 
ful that  such  an  act  of  faith  would  be 
"incorrect".  And  yet  —  it  is  really 
only  men  who  belong  to  the  various 
"classes";  women  belong  to  these 
classes  by  belonging  to  the  men. 
Chesler  writes  in  "Women,  Money  & 


Power":  "As  many  women  of  the 
Watergate  crisis  have  shown  us, 
Great  Ladies  are  always  one  man 
away  from  'the  top'  —  and  one  man 
away  'from  welfare'  ".20  And  Andrea 
Dworkin  writes  in  her  essay  "Phallic 
Imperialism:  Why  Economic 
Recovery  Will  Not  Work  For  Us"  (in 
last  December's  MS.):  "When  the 
man  is  rich,  his  wife  does  not  clean 
the  house;  instead,  she  is  turned  into 
an  ornament,  a  decoration,  and  used 
as  a  symbol  of  his  wealth  .  .  .  The 
phenomenon  of  the  lady  is  a  bizarre 
variation  on  a  consistently  cruel 
theme."  "Everywhere  .  .  .  the  female 
is  kept  in  captivity  by  the  male  ..." 
We  all  really  know  this.  A  glance  in 
the  street  from  a  man  of  any  class  can 
let  a  woman  of  any  "class"  know  her 
true  status. 

There  have  been  many  discussions 
of  class  among  us,  and  from  them  we 
have  learned  a  great  deal  about  one 
another.  Yet  these  exchanges  have 
sometimes  been  so  painful  that  the 
women  involved  have  split  apart.  My 
guess  is  that  it  has  most  often  been 
indirectly  that  we  have  closed  this 
particular  distance  between  us  —  as 
we  exchanged  stories  of  sexual 
experience,  and  came  more  and  more 
to  recognize  that  these  stories  show 
all  of  us  to  be  servants  to  men.  Their 
servants  or,  if  we  refuse  to  be  their 
servants,  outlaws. 

I  think  that  the  consciousness- 
raising  session  is  the  basic  building 
block  of  our  revolution.  The  more  we 
describe  our  lives  to  one  another,  and 
to  ourselves,  the  more  we  realize  that 
the  condition  of  all  women  is  essen- 
tially the  same  condition;  and  that  we 
could  act  together  to  refuse  that  con- 
dition. 

But  it  does  take  a  kind  of  faith  to 


Remembering/71 


sit  together  and  confide  our  lives  to 
one  another  in  this  way.  The  faith 
that  we  won't  find  that  we  have 
exposed  ourselves  only  to  be  sudden- 
ly rejected.  I  think  that  the  women's 
movement  needs  a  kind  of  Law  of 
Return  —  like  the  law  that  says  that 
any  Jew  can  find  a  welcome  in  Israel. 
I  think  that  any  woman  who  decides 
that  she  lives  in  slavery  and  wants  to 
deliver  herself  from  that  slavery 
should  know  that  she  will  be 
welcomed  as  a  sister  by  other  women 
making  the  same  struggle.  If  she 
takes  a  few  steps  toward  freedom 
and  becomes  frightened  and  retreats, 
she  should  know  that  she  will  be 
welcomed  back  into  the  struggle 
whenever  she  finds  her  courage 
again.  She  is  more  likely  to  find  it  if 
she  does  know  this.  She  should  know 
that  she  would  be  welcomed  back  any 
number  of  times,  never  told,  "You 
cannot  be  one  of  us". 

I  am  not  saying  that  we  can  trust 
all  sisters  to  do  us  no  harm.  We 
begin,  all  of  us,  in  a  state  of  fear;  we 
begin  having  been  trained  to  give 
obedience  to  liars,  on  fear  of  punish- 
ment. So  we  have  to  learn  to  relate  to 
one  another  as  free  spirits.  The  trust 
that  we  have  to  dare  to  give  is  the 
trust  that  we  can  learn.  There  are  sure 
to  be  many  instances  in  which  we  do 
each  other  injury.  When  any  woman 
feels  she  has  been  injured  she  should 
speak  of  it.  Though  I  recommend 
naming  the  injury  received  rather 
than  trying  to  name  the  motives  of 
those  who've  injured  us.  It  is  also 
only  common  sense  when  under- 
taking certain  kinds  of  actions  to 
choose  as  companions  women  with 
whom  we  feel  at  ease.  But  —  very 
simply  —  I  think  no  woman  should 
be  judged   unfit   to  be  seeking  her 


freedom.  We  learn  to  be  free  as  we 
begin  to  dare  to  act  not  as  we  have 
been  taught  that  we  "should"  but  — 
as  the  Quakers  say  —  according  to  the 
light  that  is  in  us.  That  light  may  still 
be  faint.  It  is  nevertheless  the  light  by 
which  we  have  to  try  to  see,  if  we  are 
going  to  put  off  slavery.  We 
shouldn't  frighten  each  other  into 
doubting  this.  The  magic  of  C-R  is 
that  because  we  don't  frighten  each 
other  into  saying  simply  what  we 
think  we  should,  we  do  begin  to  be 
able  to  see  by  our  own  light.  In  fear 
for  ourselves,  we  have  kept  this  light 
covered.  Now  we  begin  to  "let  it 
shine"  —  to  steal  a  phrase  from  a  60's 
black  freedom  song.  Sometimes  in- 
tellect gives  us  this  light;  sometimes 
our  very  bodies  give  it.  We  begin  to 
pay  attention  to  bodily  sensations 
which  are  comments  upon 
experience;  or  comments  upon  words 
we  start  to  say  but  realize  that  we 
don't  mean.  And  because  we  speak 
without  fear  of  one  another,  and  so 
begin  to  speak  —  to  know  —  what  has 
really  been  true  for  us,  I  have  never 
sat  in  such  a  circle  in  which  any 
woman,  no  matter  how  new  to  the 
struggle,  has  not  had  something  to 
tell  from  which  I  have  learned. 

You  have  objected  to  what  you  call 
the  "line"  that  "anything  a  woman 
does  should  be  supported  because 
she  is  a  woman".  That  would  of 
course  be  a  ridiculous  line  to  follow. 
But  to  support  the  attempt  of  all 
women  to  learn  to  see  with  their  own 
eyes  —  this,  I  think,  is  necessary  to 
our  revolution.  As  we  give  this  sup- 
port, the  lives  of  other  women 
become  almost  as  real  to  us  as  our 
own  lives;  and  our  own  lives,  because 
of  this,  become  more  known  to  us  — 
our  lives,  and  the  needs  which  those 


72/Quest 


lives  have  suppressed,  which  are  also 
the  needs  of  other  women.  And 
without  even  aiming  at  it  directly,  we 
prepare  ourselves  to  take  action 
together  —  to  change  our  lives,  to 
meet  our  needs.  Action  in  which  we 
don't  take  a  leader's  orders;  actions 
that  come  to  seem  irrepressible.  None 
of  us  trying  to  pressure  any  other 
sister  to  join  us  if  she  is  not  yet  ready; 
or  if,  from  her  perspective,  the 
project  makes  little  sense.  Each  of  us 
encouraged  to  act  upon  her  own 
sense  of  the  truth.  More  and  more 
confident  that  what  will  seem 
necessary  to  one  will  seem  necessary 
to  many. 

The  very  same  women  who  will 
come  to  trust  one  another  in  this  way, 
and  find  that  they  can  often  act 
together,  if  they  had  sat  together  and 
exchanged  not  experiences  but 
opinions,  might  well  have  always  felt 
at  odds.  In  a  C-R  group  of  which  I 
was  a  part  for  several  years,  a  group 
in  which  we  developed  the  deepest 
kind  of  loving  trust  in  one  another,  it 
occurred  to  us  after  a  number  of 
months  together  to  ask  how  we 
would  label  ourselves  politically.  Our 
answers  marked  us  in  total  contradic- 
tion with  one  another  —  some  of  us 
radical,  some  liberal,  some  conser- 
vative. I  remember  beginning  to 
laugh.  For  we  had  been  finding  that 
we  had  more  and  more  in  common, 
and  knew  by  then  that  we  would 
continue  to  draw  closer  to  one 
another.  As  more  months  passed, 
some  of  us  discovered,  of  course,  that 
our  true  political  inclinations  were 
more  radical  than  we  had  known  they 
were. 

It  is  simply  more  productive,  in  the 
feminist  struggle,  to  try  to  discover 
commonality  among  us  than  it  is  to 


try  to  find  contradictions. 

Dialecticians,  for  the  most  part, 
have  been  men.  And  under 
patriarchy  men  have  sought  their 
very  identities  in  terms  of  contradic- 
tion. A  "man"  is  one  who  is  not  a 
woman;  not  really  flesh  of  a  woman's 
flesh.  And  so  among  revolutionaries 
contradiction  has  assumed  an  impor- 
tance almost  hypnotic.  I  think  we 
have  to  awaken  from  this  hypnosis. 
The  truth  is  that  we  discover 
ourselves  best  as  we  discover  how  all 
our  lives  are  linked. 

Engels  writes  that  "Without  com- 
monality nothing  would  exist."  In 
one  piece  of  writing,  Engels  himself 
acknowledges  this.  There  is  a 
beautiful  passage  in  the  introduction 
to  his  "Dialectics  Of  Nature"  in 
which  he  imagines  the  end  of  our 
world.  "Nothing,"  he  says,  "is  eter- 
nal but  eternally  changing,  eternally 
moving  matter  and  the  laws  accord- 
ing to  which  it  moves  and  changes", 
and  however  often  suns  and  earths 
come  into  being  and  go  out  of  being, 
and  with  them  all  the  innumerable 
variations  of  life,  "we  have  the  cer- 
tainty that  matter  remains  eternally 
the  same  in  all  its  transformations, 
that  none  of  its  attributes  can  ever  be 
lost",21  and  so  however  sure  it  is  to 
exterminate  even  the  highest  forms 
of  life,  it  is  also  sure  to  engender 
them  again. 

Reading  this  passage,  it  struck  me 
that  it  bore  a  surprising  resemblance 
to  descriptions  I  had  read  of  the  Great 
Mother,  who  is  Death  Mother  and 
Life  Mother,  both;  who  experiences 
innumerable  transformations  and 
who  remains  eternally  the  same,  able 
always  to  engender  all  things  over 
again.  In  The  Mother,  all  things  exist. 
The    words   "matter"    and   "mater" 


Remembering/73 


(mother)  are  of  course  very  close. 
Something  for  materialists  to  muse 
about,  I  think. 

Beyond  all  contradiction,  female 
and  male  are  matter  and  are  also 
mater,  flesh  of  their  mother's  flesh  — 
the  male  as  a  fetus,  in  the  beginning 
female,  too;  then  becoming  a  varia- 
tion of  the  female.  Until  this  truth  is 
accepted,  the  so-called  materialist  is 
not  really  a  materialist. 


Rich  writes  in  "Of  Woman  Born", 
"The  repossession  by  women  of  our 
bodies  will  bring  far  more  essential 
change  to  human  society  than  the 
seizing  of  the  means  of  production  by 
workers."22  I  deeply  assent.  And  as 
long  as  the  bodies  of  women  are  held 
in  contempt  by  most  of  those  who 
teach  dialectics,  dialectical 
materialism  will  remain  an  in- 
adequate "tool  of  liberation".

bibliography. 

"...makes  a  real  contribution  to  our 
developing  insight  into  the  conver- 
gence of  sex,  race,  and  class  as  defining 
factors  in  Southern  women's  life 
experience." 

—Elizabeth  Meese,  Director

Challenging 

Assertiveness 

Training 


By  MAY  SCHNEIDT 

graphics  by  Anne  Popperwell 

Rita  Mae  Brown's  "It's  All  Dixie 
Cups  To  Me/'*  struck  a  chord  that 
was  still  twanging  from  a  recent 
experience  in  an  assertiveness 
training  workshop.  I  learned  in  —  of 
all  places,  a  women's  center  —  the  gut 
meaning  of  the  expression  "wiped 
out."  For  those  who  are  on  the 
borderline  of  the  expendable  anyway 
(wrong  color,  age,  size,  shape,  or 
economic,  educational  or  ethnic 
background),  assertiveness  training 
games  can  be  the  catalyst  for  turning 
women  into  garbage. 

When  I  read  "It's  All  Dixie  Cups 
To  Me,"  I  recognized  some  of  the  un- 
derlying forces  endemic  to  our 
culture  that  set  up  both  the  women 
who  become  victims  and  those  who 
lose  themselves  in  attempting  to 
manufacture  a  new  identity.  Prac- 
ticing assertiveness  while  insensitive 
to  others'  feelings  can  hardly  build  a 
strong  self-concept.  Self-hatred 
turned  outward  onto  others  destroys 
trust  and  hides  an  inauthentic  self 
behind  aggressive  actions. 

Movement  women  know  how  long 
it  takes  to  build  a  cohesive  group,  to 
become  a  pro-woman  in  a  woman- 


hating  culture.  It  takes  even  longer  to 
eliminate  the  competitiveness  and 
other  ways  through  which  this 
phallocentric  society  divides  us  from 
each  other.  How  can  we  expect  a 
diverse  group  of  unacquainted 
women  to  come  together  for  a  day  or 
two,  to  work  exclusively  on 
becoming  assertive,  and  to  ignore  all 
the  differences,  motivations,  expec- 
tations and  prejudices  they've 
brought  with  them? 

Something  mysterious  happens  to 
most  of  us  once  we  embark  on  that 
shopping  trip  to  "replace  ourselves." 
It  has  to  do  with  our  basic  belief  in 
self-improvement:  I'm  not  good 
enough,  but  do  not  despair;  there  is 
always  someone  ready,  willing,  and 
able  to  help  me  improve  myself.  If 
that  is  not  exactly  a  set-up,  the  next 
belief  is:  In  order  to  benefit,  I  must 
trust  the  process  and  do  as  I'm  told. 
Follow  The  Leader. 

It  is  frightening  to  think  about  the 
extent  of  our  readiness  to  go  along 
with  virtually  any  request  once  we 
are  committed  to  the  project.  That 
chilling  Miligrim  experiment  which 
tested  the  willingness  of  subjects  to 
give  an  unseen  person  increasingly 
painful  jolts  of  electricity  for  wrong 
replies    simply    on    the    word    of

authority  in  charge,  exemplifies  our 
propensity  to  relinquish  control  over 
our  psychic  processes  to  an  authority 
figure. 

Destructive  aspects  are  released 
when  assertiveness  training  extends 
"permission"  to  exercise  power  over 
others  who  are  less  assertive.  That 
liberating  techniques  can  unleash 
hostile  attitudes  toward  other  women 
is  demonstrated  even  in  the  training 
workshops  themselves,  where  long- 
repressed  women  are  suddenly  freed 
to  exercise  newly-discovered  powers. 
An  unconscious  twenty-year-old,  in 
an  "eyeball  to  eyeball"  exercise,  can 
effectively  destroy  the  self-esteem  of 
a  middle-aged  woman  contesting  a 
divorce  action,  who  hopes  asser- 
tiveness training  will  teach  her  how 
to  cope  with  her  husband,  his  lawyer, 
and  her  own  attorney,  who  treats  her 
like  a  fool.  The  object  of  the  exercise 
may  be  to  de-sensitize  her  to  the 
worst  that  a  sexist  society  has  to 
offer,  but  a  vitriolic  assault  that  tells 
her  that  it  is  too  late  for  an  over-the- 
hill  lady  to  become  assertive,  that  she 
has  no  business  inflicting  her 
presence  on  women  so  much  younger 
than  she,  and  that  the  sympathy  is  all 
for  her  poor  husband  anyway,  will 
hardly  do  more  than  give  added 
proof  that  she  has  indeed  become 
garbage  and  should  be  carted  away 
quickly.  It  is  asking  a  bit  too  much  to 
expect  her  to  look  objectively  at  the 
"game,"  as  if  all  the  hostility  lying 
just  below  the  surface,  considered  too 
impolite  to  voice,  can  now  be 
expressed  with  impunity. 

Even  if  an  assertiveness  training 
workshop  is  at  a  women's  center,  this 
does  not  mean  that  all  the  par- 
ticipants will  be  feminists. 
Professionals  place  their  ads  in  many 


publications  in  order  to  draw  from  a 
larger  readership.  Training  sessions 
are  open  to  all  women  and  waiting 
lists  often  are  long. 

What  onus  does  this  put  on 
women's  centers?  Do  movement 
women  have  a  responsibility  to  see 
that  the  center  remains  a  reasonably 
safe  place?  What  are  the  chances  of 
centers  being  used  as  rip-offs  by 
professional  and  para-professional 
women  jumping  on  the  bandwagon 
that  sells  multitudes  of  programs  like 
snake  oil? 

I  believe  that  women  must  assume 
responsiblity  for  the  content  of  asser- 
tiveness training  workshops  which 
are  held  in  women's  centers.  I  would 
go  even  further  and  say  that  we  have 
a  responsibility  to  find  out  what  is 
being  sold  under  the  heading  of 
"Assertiveness  Training,"  in  other 
locations  as  well.  Alerting  prospec- 
tive clients  to  a  leader's  methods, 
aims  and  orientation  can  go  a  long 
way  toward  insuring  that  a  partici- 
pant will  at  least  refuse  to  relinquish 
her  right  to  say  "no"  to  a  situation 
that  threatens  her  integrity.  In  addi- 
tion, a  recognition  of  the  differences 
in  basic  assumptions  of  the  trainers 
themselves,  and  a  willingness  to 
publicly  question  the  validity  of 
those  assumptions,  would  signal 
pseudo-feminists  not  to  expect  to 
practice  their  brand  of  training  un- 
detected. 

There  is  a  wide  range  of  ideologies 
among  group  leaders.  Some  express 
an  awareness  of  sexual  politics,  and  it 
is  with  these  women  that  our  best 
hopes  lie.  By  clarifying  the  long- 
range  goals  of  assertiveness  training, 
and  focusing  on  enlarging  the 
political  vision  of  their  clients, 
positive  changes  could  be  effected. 


Challenging  Assertiveness  Training/77 


Anne  Popperwell 

For  instance,  there  is  Betsy  Belote, 
a  psychologist  and  workshop  leader 
whose  politics  are  feminist  and  who 
does  not  believe  that  holding  fast  to 
"femininity"  is  congruent  with  asser- 
tiveness.  She  sees  quite  realistically 
that  "feminity"  as  it  is  clinically 
defined  is  a  pathological  state  and 
that  becoming  assertive  involves 
relinquishing  this  pathology: 
".  .  .  the    conditioning    of    assertive 


behavior  and  attitudes  in  women  in- 
volves the  simultaneous  development 
of  a  greater  awareness  of  sexism  and 
the  concomitant  gestation  of  a  per- 
sonal identity  revolution  within  each 
woman.  Male  acceptance  or  support 
is  neither  necessary  nor  desirable  to 
the  success  of  this  process."1 

But  we  also  have  workshop  leaders 
such  as  Pamela  Butler,  who  worries 
about  women  being  misled  by  un- 
warranted fears  "that  by  becoming 
more  assertive,  they  will  have  to  give 
up  desirable  feminine  qualities."  Dr. 
Butler  views  assertion  training  as 
suited  to  both  sexes,  not  as  "a 
procedure  designed  to  separate  men 
and  women."2  The  rhetoric  employed 
here  plays  on  women's  fears  of  sex 
role  loss  and  equates  a  pro-woman 
stance  with  an  anti-male  position. 

In  workshops,  a  feminist  con- 
sciousness may  be  taken  for  granted 
or  not  considered  at  all.  The  ways  in 
which  women  are  oppressed  by  their 
roles  are  examined,  but  the  energies 
that  will  be  set  free  by  the  training  are 
left  to  find  their  own  outlets.  As  a 
letter  in  Ms.  Magazine  observed, 
following  an  article  on  assertiveness: 
"The  examples,  with  few  exceptions, 
have  been  lessons  on  how  to  bully 
sales  clerks  and  other  functionaries 
(who  are  usually  women)."3 

Men  are  aware  that  pride  in 
themselves  as  individuals  is  tied  up 
with  personal  aggressiveness.  There 
is  no  reason  to  doubt  that  women 
have  this  same  knowledge  about 
themselves.  The  trigger  of  permission 
which  allows  women  to  discharge 
their  aggression  onto  safe  targets  is 
not  only  self-rewarding,  but  tends  to 
reinforce  the  need  for  an  aggressive 
stance. 


78/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  1,  summer,  1977 


Years  before  Manuel  Smith's 
book,  When  I  Say  No,  I  Feel  Guilty, 
was  published  and  became  a  guide 
for  assertiveness  training,  Margaret 
Drabble  wrote  The  Millstone  (Thank 
You  All  Very  Much),4  which  con- 
tains a  segment  Smith  might  well 
have  used  to  demonstrate  asser- 
tiveness. In  both  book  and 
screenplay,  Rosamund  finds  herself 
up  against  an  immovable 
bureaucracy  in  a  hospital  which  will 
not  allow  her  to  see  her  infant 
daughter  following  heart  surgery. 
She  decides  that  it  is  definitely  in  the 
best  interests  of  herself  and  her  baby 
that  she  be  with  her  right  away.  In 
the  confrontation  which  ensues,  Ms. 
Drabble  makes  it  clear  that  the  two 
young  nurses  are  frightened  tools  of 
the  establishment.  They  have  strict 
orders  to  follow,  and  they  must 
remove  Rosamund  from  the  nursing 
Sister's  office  before  she  returns. 
Rosamund  feels  sorry  for  them  but 
sorrier  for  her  baby,  and  refuses  to 
budge.  She  uses  all  the  techniques  of 
assertiveness  later  to  be  defined  by 
Smith  in  his  book: 

"I  must  see  my  baby,"  she  says.  "I 
don't  really  care  whether  I'm  allowed 
to  visit  or  not."  (broken  record)  (self- 
disclosure)  "If  you'll  tell  me  where  it 
is,  I'll  get  there  by  myself  ..." 
(workable  compromise)  "I  must  see 
her."  (broken  record)  "If  you  won't 
let  me  go,  go  and  get  Sister  or 
Matron,  or  whatever  she's  called.  Go 
and  fetch  her  for  me.  Or  I'll  wait  here 
till  she  comes."  (broken  record) 
(workable  compromise). 

When  Sister  returns,  she  asserts 
her  authority  over  the  young  nurse 
still  remaining,  and  plays  her  own 
version  of  broken  record  to  Rosa- 
mund, who  then  asserts  herself:  "I 


Anne  Popperwell 

don't  want  to  discuss  anything,  I've 
jome  to  visit  my  baby."  (self- 
disclosure)  (broken  record). 

Rosamund  thinks:  "I  felt  happier 
now;  I  had  not  enjoyed  upsetting 
those  unimpressive  nurses,  whose 
discomfort  in  the  situation  had  been 
almost  as  great  as  mine.  In  Sister, 
however,  I  sense  the  kind  of  will  that 
can  be  fought:  she  found  pleasure, 
not  to  torment,  in  assertion,  so  I  felt 
free  to  assert  myself  too." 

Ms.  Drabble's  insights  into  the 
self -re  warding  aspects  of 
aggressiveness  is  apparent  in  the 
sense  of  pleasure  she  attributes  to 
both  women  in  a  situation  one  would 
normally  see  as  appalling. 


Assertiveness  Training/79 


Manuel  Smith's  entire  glossary  is 
played  and  replayed  until  a  physical 
confrontation  results.  When  Sister 
clamps  a  firm  grip  on  Rosamund  and 
propels  her  to  the  office  door,  the 
situation  is  immediately  escalated. 
Rosamund  simply  closes  her  eyes, 
plants  her  feet  and  begins  screaming: 
".  .  .  listening  in  amazement  to  the 
defeaning  shindy  that  filled  my  head. 
Once  I  had  started,  I  could  not  stop;  I 
stood  there,  motionless,  screaming, 
whilst  they  shook  me  and  yelled  at 
me  and  told  me  that  I  was  upsetting 
everybody  in  earshot." 

Eyes  tight  shut,  she  goes  on 
screaming,  conscious  all  the  while  of 
people  coming  and  going  and  things 
happening,  and  does  not  cease  until 
she  hears  a  man's  voice  saying:  "For 
God's  sake  tell  her  she  can  see  the 
baby,  someone  try  and  tell  her."  She 
opened  her  eyes,  "Did  you  say  I 
could  see  the  baby?" 

"Of  course  you  can  see  the  baby," 
said  Mr.  Protheroe.  "Of  course  you 
can  see  the  baby.  I  cannot  imagine 
why  you  should  have  ever  been 
prevented  from  seeing  the  baby." 

Mr.  Protheroe  is,  of  course,  a  very 
big  wheel  in  the  hospital.  It  was  he 
who  performed  the  delicate  surgery 
on  Rosamund's  baby  in  this  huge 
teaching  hospital,  and  his  commands 
are  instantly  obeyed. 

Ms.  Drabble  has  Rosamund  think: 
"I  looked  at  the  breathless  circle  sur- 
rounding me,  which  had  changed  its 
composition  considerably  since  I  had 
last  seen  it:  Mr.  Protheroe  himself 
looked  agitated  and  white  with  anger, 
Sister  was  sitting  in  a  corner  and 
crying  into  a  handkerchief,  the 
nurses  were  looking  stunned,  and 
there  were  several  more  men  also 
looking  angry.  It  was  as  though  I  had 


opened  my  eyes  on  a  whole  narrative 
caught  in  a  single  picture,  a  narrative 
in  which  I  myself  had  taken  no  part; 
it  had  been  played  out  between  the 
Sister  and  the  others,  quite  clearly, 
and  she  had  lost  and  was  now  suf- 
fering her  defeat.  It  was  nothing  to 
do  with  me  at  all." 

Of  course  we  must  become  asser- 
tive, aggressive,  and  when  the  occa- 
sion demands,  not  hesitate  to  scream 
the  place  down,  expecially  when 
regulations  are  set  like  cement  in 
bureaucratic  institutions,  and  orders 
that  must  be  followed  descend  from 
the  policy  makers  at  the  top,  from  a 
male  hierarch.  Ms.  Drabble  lets  the 
reader  feel  sympathy  for  the  young 
nurses,  whose  jobs,  daily  well-being, 
and  future  advancement  depend 
upon  their  willingness  to  keep  their 
part  of  the  big  machine  running 
smoothly.  These  two  are  beginning  in 
earnest  the  ongoing  process  of  self- 
alienation  and  erosion  of  individual 
will.  Its  completion  will  guarantee  in- 
tegration into  the  existing  system. 

But,  there  is  a  total  lack  of  sym- 
pathy for  the  Sister,  who  is  herself 
nothing  but  another  instrument  of 
the  system.  The  struggle  for  survival 
that  a  woman  of  her  age  has  endured 
in  order  to  reach  her  present  position 
seems  beyond  the  author's  com- 
prehension. It  is  precisely  the  kind  of 
situation  that  allows  a  woman-hating 
culture  to  savor  vicariously  the 
punishment  any  woman  who  steps 
out  of  her  passive  role  must  endure. 

Rosamund  won.  But,  "Nothing  to 
do  with  me  at  all,"  seems  a  remark  of 
yet  another  woman  who  is  "...  a 
spectator  to  her  own  life."  How 
much  gain  for  all  of  us  if  Ms.  Drab- 
ble had  exposed  all  the  operative  fac- 
tors. Here  is  a  chance  for  an  author  to 


80/Quest 


examine  the  strictures  that  go  into 
destroying  the  human  attributes  of 
women  who  must  struggle  in- 
dependently and  so  inhumanely  to 
advance  careers  within  the  system. 

Rosamund  won  a  personal  victory, 
but  her  aggressiveness  did  nothing  to 
change  the  inhuman  rules  of  the  in- 
stitution. I  think  this  is  the  key  to  the 
reason  assertiveness  training  falls 
short.  As  long  as  women  value  a 
male-oriented  culture  and  are 
motivated  to  seek  techniques  which 
will  make  them  more  proficient  in 
using  surrogate  power  to  become 
better  oppressors  along  the  way 
toward  getting  what  they  personally 
want,  assertiveness  training  will  con- 
tinue to  lack  goals  geared  toward 
effecting  societal  changes. 

Assertiveness  training  will  have 
real  meaning  only  when  its  im- 
plementation brings  it  into  direct 
confrontation  with  male  attitudes 
and  behavior  that  are  inimical  to 
women.  As  long  as  the  goal  of  asser- 
tiveness training  is  to  improve  one's 
function  within  the  confines  of  the 
existing  system,  it  cannot  have 
political  value  for  women.  It  may  im- 
prove an  individual  woman's  ability 
to  cope,  but  it  will  not  force  the 
patriarchal  system  to  change.  As  long 
as  no  real  pressures  are  brought  to 
bear,  society  can  contain  its  assertive 
women  while  doing  nothing  to  im- 
prove conditions. 

The  tacit  approval  of  sexism,  and 
the  use  of  assertive  behavior  as 
another  manipulative  tool  to  help  the 
victim  "one-up"  her  oppressor 
without  demanding  that  her  op- 
pressor change  his  ways,  is  self- 
defeating  in  the  long  run.  As  long  as 
the  majority  of  women  accept  sexist 
attitudes,  we  will  continue  in  the  role 


of  victim,  our  feeble  efforts  at  asser- 
tiveness easily  absorbed  by  society. 

How  can  women  be  united  while  a 
scheme  of  division  continues  to  exist? 
How  can  we  examine  these  divisions 
if  we  go  on  taking  them  for  granted 
as  normal  behavior? 

Ms.  Drabble's  characterization  of 
the  nursing  Sister  is  an  accurate  por- 
trayal and  is  certainly  not  a  parody. 
She  is  the  prototype  for  women  who 
have  had  to  "make  it'  in  a  man's 
world  and  on  his  terms.  It  is  the  non- 
conscious  acceptance  of  sexism 
which  forms  the  psychic  sub- 
structure from  which  women's 
motivational  forces  spring.  That  sub- 
structure is  a  fact  of  psychic  life  we 
have  yet  to  deal  with  realistically. 
Denial  of  its  existence  prevents  us 
from  undermining  it,  just  as  tacit 
acceptance  reinforces  it. 

Like  Sister,  women  seldom 
acknowledge  that  they  have  "made 
it"  on  the  Man's  terms.  The  ultimate 
in  mystification  occurs  when  women 
take  pride  in  being  metamorphosed 
into  flak-catchers  for  white  male 
technocrats. 

The  paradox  is  that  while  women 
need  to  learn  how  to  assert 
themselves,  they  cannot  make  much 
use  of  their  assertiveness  in  en- 
counters where  they  are  powerless. 
Furthermore,  men  are  threatened  by 
women  who  assert  themselves,  and 
while  comparatively  few  will  resort 
to  physical  abuse,  it  is  a  very  real 
possibility.  That  possibility  is  one  of 
the  greatest  psychological  weapons 
that  the  society  of  men  has  in  its 
arsenal  to  keep  women  in  their  place. 

In  The  Millstone,  the  mis-use  of 
power  is  obvious  in  the  way  the 
Sister  can  assert  herself  against  her 
subordinates  and  against  mothers  ac- 


Assertiveness  Training/81

82/Quest 


customed  to  being  ordered  around 
because  they  are  powerless.  Sister  is 
not  in  a  position  to  assert  herself  with 
those  who  control  her  job.  The 
system  effectively  cuts  off  her 
channels  of  authentic  self-expression 
and  distorts  her  use  of  power.  It  is 
precisely  this  painful  sense  of  im- 
potence that  is  relieved  by  the  exter- 
nalization  of  any  act  that  will  have  a 
significant  impact  on  another.  It  is 
hardly  coincidental  that  these 
"policing"  acts,  which  serve  to  widen 
the  gulf  between  women,  are  in- 
variably repressive. 

Where,  then,  does  all  this  leave  us? 
If  we  are  ever  to  effect  changes  in  the 
underlying  system,  we  must  learn 
how  to  assert  ourselves  to  cause 
changes  from  wherever  we  happen  to 
be.  Progressively  and  consistently 
utilizing  subtle  forms  of  sabotage, 
rather  than  flamboyant  self- 
immolation,  is  surely  a  more  practical 
method  of  undermining  the  foun- 
dations of  the  entrenched  system. 

There  are  women  who  share  a 
feminist  consciousness,  are  aware  of 
the  oppressive  nature  of  sexism  and 
are  using  assertive  techniques  as  they 
pursue  careers  on  turf  men  would 
prefer  to  keep  sacrosanct.  In  many 
cases  joint  action  among  these 
highly-motivated  women  has 
resulted  in  changes  in  policy  toward 
female  employees. 

One  employee  of  National  Educa- 
tion Television  reveals  a  keen  sense 
of  the  need  to  re-examine  our  values: 

"But  I'm  afraid  that  unless  we  can 
effect  these  changes  on  our  own 
terms,  with  a  sense  of  our  own 
values,  then  we're  doomed  to  catch 
the  sickness  that  infects  men  in  their 
work.  But  where  to  forge  these  new, 
immunizing  values?  What  concerns 


me  most  at  NET  is  not  the  specifics  of 
salary  and  promotion,  but  the  effect 
of  discriminatory  attitudes  upon 
women  .  .  .  the  implicit  acceptance  of 
inferiority,  the  internalizing  of  a 
degraded  self-image.  And  so  I  feel 
that  when  a  woman  works  at  NET, 
she  will  continue  to  arrive  at  a  critical 
juncture  when  she  will  look  beyond 
the  equivocal  picture  presented  by 
employment  facts  and  ask  herself 
whether  she  will  be  able  to  chart  an 
alternate  course  .  .  .  within  its  own 
values  .  .  .  within  a  structure  that 
provides  few  models  and  little  en- 
couragement."5 

How  can  assertiveness  training  be 
augmented  to  break  through  shells 
that  seem  so  impervious  to 
penetration?  Women  have  most  cer- 
tainly been  denied  opportunities  for 
self-fulfillment,  and  many  are  quick 
to  seize  upon  assertive  action 
whenever  it  is  safe  to  do  so. 
Thwarted  by  an  inability  to  gain  con- 
trol over  our  lives,  suppressed 
energies,  once  undammed,  too  often 
pour  out,  causing  the  recipient  a 
great  deal  of  pain.  Isn't  assertive 
behavior  very  often  the  same  op- 
pressive behavior  many  women  in 
positions  of  petty  authority  have 
always  used  so  deplorably? 

I  have  a  lot  of  sympathy  for  the 
conditions  many  older  women  have 
suffered  throughout  their  working 
lives,  and  I  can  understand  the 
process  of  self-alienation  that  results 
in  a  fragmented  life,  but  I  would  not 
care  to  work  under  one  of  these 
women.  Natural  attrition  is  probably 
the  only  way  most  of  our  hardened 
cases  will  be  relieved  of  their  com- 
mand. 

To  prevent  more  women  from 
these    pitfalls,    the   goals    of    asser- 


Assertiveness  Training/83 


tiveness  training  must  be  explored. 
There  has  to  be  a  conscious  effort  to 
emphasize  the  ways  politics  touch 
our  day-to-day  lives,  and  an 
emphasis  on  techniques  that  will 
make  assertiveness  politically  signifi- 
cant. 

If  assertiveness  training  is  to 
become  a  tool  for  creating  new 
systems,  instead  of  merely  being  used 
to  allow  women  to  become  more 
functional  within  an  oppressive 
system,  clearer  guidelines  are 
necessary.  Much  more  is  needed  than 
techniques  that  will  enable  trainees  to 
discharge  aggression  successfully 
against  safe  targets.  Turning  more 
women  into  garbage  will  be  the 
result.  Hardly  a  noble  enterprise.

84/Quest 


Dear  Quest, 

I  have  wanted  to  write 
my  reactions  to  Quest, 
but  have  usually  felt  I 
was  just  too  far  removed 
from  the  developments  in 
the  states  which  Quest 
represents.  I  wrote  you 
all  a  poem  after  reading 
the  first  issue  which 
seemed  too  academic, 
but  decided  not  to  send 
it,  afraid,  I  suppose,  that 
my  reactions  were  "out 
of  place".  In  general, 
though,  the  issues  which 
have  seemed  from  here, 
too  American  move- 
ment-specific have  been 
compensated  by  issues, 
or  articles  in  various 
issues  which  are  solidly 
rooted  in  collective 
movement  experience 
and  have  been  tremen- 
dously valuable  to  me. 
That  American  move- 
ment-specific quality 
should  not  be  a  weak- 
ness if  it  is  a  matter 
of  content,  but  some- 
times it  is  a  matter 
of  style,  verbiage  which 
makes  the  reader  feel 
like  a  dope  for  not  being 
able  to  get  the  point,  or 


etters 


absolute,  though,  I  feel 
the  oppressiveness  of 
American  boldness 
rather  than  its  honesty.  I 
guess  "absolute"  here 
means  facilely  elevating 
partial  insights  into  ab- 
solute truths.  This  is 
sometimes  a  matter  of 
implication,  nuance 
more  than  plain  state- 
ment. I  look  forward  to 
seeing  the  International 
issue.

Dear  Quest: 

In  reference  to  Ms. 
Mendheim's  letter  which 
I  understand  will  be 
appearing  in  your 
current  issue,  I  have  this 
to  say.  Ms. Beverly 
Mendheim  is  obviously 
the  sort  of  student 
scholar  who  is  more  in- 
terested in  her  own 
collection  of  limited  facts 
than  in  the  greater 
overall  history  of 
civilization.  All  pre- 
history is  theoretically 
put  together  to  be  inter- 
preted by  those  who  care 
to.    My    informal    radio 


like  a  cop-out  for  rejec- 
ting abstract  thinking.  I 
liked  the  interview  with 
Joanna  Russ  and  was 
glad  to  feel  "texture" 
through  it. 

The  issue  on  "Money, 
Fame  &  Power"  is  really 
good.  I  hope  to  share  the 
Reid  and  Fisher  articles 
with  women  here.  The 
problems  they  deal  with 
are  fundamentally  the 
same  here,  and  they  are 
discussed  in  such  a 
straightforward  way 
that  one  makes  the 
bridge  to  one's  own 
situation.  (Probably 
some  of  the  other  articles 
would  also  appear  more 
relevant  if  they  weren't 
couched  in  language 
somehow  .  .  .  "we've 
arrived"  .  .  .  "have  you 
arrived?")  Anyway,  the 
A-No.  1  thing  which  I 
congratulate  you  for  is 
the  magazine's  dedica- 
tion to  concretely  advan- 
cing women's  ability  to 
gain  power.  You  are 
bold,  you  dream,  you  try 
things  out.  I,  we,  here 
need  to  learn  to  be 
bolder.    When   you    are

interview,  transcribed 
for  Quest,  ("Lifing  the 
Veil  of  Isis/'  Vol.  II,  No. 
2,  Fall  '76)  never  claimed 
to  be  a  devotedly 
scholarly  "article"  as 
Ms.  Mendheim  calls  it. 
You  had  rejected  prin- 
ting my  more  scholarly 
article  on  the  "belly 
dance"  with  its  reference 
to  the  research  of 
Morroe  Berger  of 
Princeton  who  has 
written  extensively  on 
the  sociological  origins 
of  the  "belly  dance,"  in 
favor  of  printing  the  in- 
formal radio  interview 
with  Esther  Swartz.  That 
is  why  I  am  offended 
that  you  chose  to  print 
Ms.  Mendheim's  unjust 
and  totally  unfounded 
criticism  of  the  inter- 
view. Her  letter  seems 
unnecessarily  hostile 
and  personally  pejor- 
ative against  me  and 
Quest. 

I  will  not  return  Ms. 
Mendheim's  personal 
insults  but  I  will  say  that 
she  is  dead  wrong  about 
the  "Ohelo"  hula  of 
Hawaii,  a  more  ancient 
dance  than  the  one  she 
seems  familiar  with.  She 
is  also  incorrect  about 
some  of  her  North 
African  theory.  I  am  well 
aware  of  the  "birth 
dance,"  as  I  call  it,  in 
African    culture,    but 


there  is  no  proof  that  the 
childbirth  interpretation 
of  the  dance  is  originally 
North  African.  Some 
scholars  say  it  is  Persian 
in  origin.  My  theory  of 
the  dance,  besides  com- 
ing from  Morroe  Berger 
of  Princeton,  is  based  on 
writings  of  Armen  Oha- 
nian,  Middle  Eastern 
culturist,  as  well  as 
writings  by  La  Meri, 
herself,  one  of  the 
greatest  ethnic  dance  ar- 
tists of  recent  times.  The 
truth  is,  one  must  put 
together  the  theories  of 
more  than  just  scholars 
of  music  and  dance,  as 
Ms.  Mendheim  has 
done.  To  understand  my 
theory,  one  would  need 
to  see  my  bibliography 
of  research  which  con- 
tains not  only  art  his- 
torians, but  sociolo- 
gists, archeologists, 
psychologists  and  all 
manner  of  scholars  and 
writers.  Ms.  Mend- 
heim's attitude  to- 
ward "Art"  seems 
narrow  and  pedantic. 

Speaking  of  Third 
World  Feminism,  as  she 
does,  I  must  tell  you  that 
I  am  one  of  only  two 
Italian-American  women 
to  receive  any  recogni- 
tion as  a  poet  in  this  en- 
tire country.  There  are 
fewer  of  us  than  Black  or 
Puerto    Rican    women 


poets,  even  though  our 
population  is  as  great.  I 
do  not  need,  as  Ms. 
Mendheim  suggests,  to 
be  concerned  about  my 
credibility  in  the  world 
of  Art.  I  have  given 
many  benefit  lecture 
performances  for  radical 
feminists,  "house- 
wives," and  artists.  I 
have  traveled  to  theatres, 
cultural  centers,  univer- 
sities, senior  citizens' 
centers,  and  prisons  all 
around  the  country,  and 
even  taught  the  belly 
dance  as  a  body-mind 
awareness  of  feminism 
to  women  inmates.  My 
multi-media  poetry  and 
dance  works  have  been 
performed  by  some  of 
the  finest  dancers  of  our 
time.  My  most  recent 
benefit  performance  of 
"The  Birth  Dance  of 
Earth"  which  does  not 
claim  to  be  based  on  any 
theories,  other  than  my 
own  theories  for  its  crea- 
tion,  was  for  the 
National  Congress  of 
Neighborhood  Women, 
an  organization  of  third 
world,  Black,  Hispanic, 
Italian  and  Polish 
women  as  well  as  radical 
feminists.  Nowhere  have 
I  received  the  hostile 
reaction  to  my  theories 
of  the  belly  dance  that 
Ms.  Mendheim  voices.

Women's  Unions 
&  Socialist 
Feminism 


By  RED  APPLE  COLLECTIVE 

graphics  by  Sue  Sellars 


The  following  analysis  was 
developed  collectively  by  Macky 
Buck,  Cindy  Deitch,  Dale  Melcher, 
Lydia  Nettler,  Edie  Spielman  and 
Ann  Wassell,  members  of  Red  Apple, 
a  community  organizing  workgroup 
of  the  Valley  Women's  Union 
(Northampton,  Massachusetts).  Red 
Apple  formed  in  1975,  using  the 
issue  of  health  to  organize  women  in 
their  community.  In  1977,  Red  Apple 
changed  its  focus  to  political  analysis 
and  study.  The  Valley  Women's 
Union,  which  has  been  in  existence 
since  1974,  is  presently  considering 
dissolution. 

Introduction 

Around  1973,  socialist-feminism 
emerged  as  a  specific  tendency  within 
the  women's  movement,  involving 
women  from  diverse  perspectives 
and  backgrounds  in  both  the 
women's    movement    and    the    left. 


Socialist-feminism  generated  a  new 
organizational  form,  a  union  of 
workgroups  and  study  groups  based 
on  a  set  of  principles  of  unity  and 
criteria  for  action.1  Unions  were 
formed  pulling  together  various 
feminist  projects  in  each  community: 
childcare,  media,  women  and  work, 
and  health  organizing,  as  well  as  rape 
crisis  centers,  presses  and  film  co- 
ops. Nationally,  the  creation  of 
women's  unions  involved  a  shift 
from  personal  perspectives  to  a  more 
political  focus,  from  service  work  to 
political  organizing,  from  visions  of  a 
revolution  for  and  by  women,  to  the 
vision  of  a  revolution  for  all  people. 

Women  worked  together 
developing  a  theory  of  patriarchy 
and  its  relationships  to  other  systems 
of  oppression,  and  accumulating  a 
body  of  collective  practice. 
Organizing  became  more  defined 
around  clearer  goals  for  long-term 
change. 

Recently,  however,  women's  un- 
ions have  been  torn  by  internal  dis- 
sention.  Many  have  folded,  and  a 
number  of  those  which  are  still  in 
existence  find  themselves  diminished 


88/Quest,  vol.  IV,  no.  1,  summer,  1977 


in  size  and  energy,  with  little  consen- 
sus on  political  definition,  structure 
and  direction.  Former  members  of 
women's  unions  have  joined  mixed- 
left  and  single-issue  women's  groups, 
or  turned  their  energies  toward 
cultural/spiritual  work,  lesbian  com- 
munities and  women's  businesses. 
For  those  of  us  who  have  been  in- 
timately connected  with  the  history 
of  socialist-feminist  women's  unions, 
it  is  painful  to  witness  their  apparent 
demise. 

Red  Apple  decided  to  face  the 
situation  head-on.  With  the  intent  of 
examining  socialist-feminist 
women's  unions  within  the  larger 
context  of  the  U.S.  women's  move- 
ment, we  gathered  information  on 
unions  dissolving  and  still  in 
existence,  on  the  present  situation  of 
NOW,  and  on  spiritual/cultural 
women's  enterprises.  We  also  read 
the  few  recent  analyses  of  the 
women's  movement  today. 

Charlotte  Bunch's  article, 
"Nonaligned  Feminism,"2  excited  us 
in  its  attempt  to  describe  problems 
facing  the  women's  movement.  She 
presented  three  directions  women  are 
choosing:  socialist  feminism,  political 
reformism,  and  cultural  spiritualism, 
advocating  a  fourth,  nonaligned 
feminism.  We  were  pushed  to 
suggest  an  alternative  analysis  in 
response  to  categories  that  didn't 
seem  to  describe  our  experience.  Bar- 
bara Ehrenreich's  concise  analysis  of 
socialist-feminism,  presented  at  the 
1976  New  England  Regional  NAM 
Conference  (New  American 
Movement),  both  validated  our  con- 
victions about  the  crucial  nature  of 
an  autonomous  socialist-feminist 
movement  and  also  suggested 
reasons  for  its  diminishing  success. 


Red  Apple  read  statements  by  and 
talked  with  women  from  Boston,  San 
Francisco,  Berkeley-Oakland, 
Chicago,  and  Springfield,  MA. 
Women's  Unions.  Most  importantly, 
members  of  Red  Apple  snared  our 
own  past  experiences  in  women's 
centers  and  women's  unions,  and  our 
present  doubts,  needs,  and  visions  of 
a  revolutionary,  autonomous 
socialist-feminist  women's  move- 
ment. 

This  paper  is  a  beginning  explora- 
tion of  the  present  situation  of  the 
socialist-feminist  movement  in  the 
U.S.,  with  the  goal  of  opening  up 
dialogue,  not  suggesting  a  complete 
analysis.  We  examine  our  experience 
with  women's  unions  and  suggest 
some  possible  future  paths.  We  start 
from  a  firm  base  that  assumes  the 
necessity  of  an  autonomous  socialist- 
feminist  movement  to  a 
revolutionary  movement,  at  this  time 
in  history.  While  acknowledging 
various  interpretations  of  this  state- 
ment, we  define  our  terms  as  follows: 
"autonomous"  assumes  a  movement 
with  its  own  internal  structure, 
politics,  and  practice  —  one  which  is 
accountable  to  itself  rather  than  to 
another  organization  or  movement.  It 
may  choose  at  various  times  to  work 
in  coalitions  with  other  groups,  but  it 
is  neither  a  caucus  in  a  larger  left 
group,  nor  a  separatist  organization 
that  never  allies  with  other  groups 
around  issues.  "Socialist-feminist" 
implies  a  unique  politics  that  ad- 
dresses the  interconnection  of  par- 
triarchy  and  capitalism,  and  has  as  its 
goal  dealing  with  sexism,  class  con- 
flict and  racism.  By  "revolutionary 
movement,"  we  mean  seeing  our  goal 
as  a  total  transformation  of  political, 
economic,  and  social  institutions  for 


Women's  Unions  and  Socialist  Feminism/89 


all  people,  and  not  accepting  reform 
as  our  end. 

Analysis 

Our  analysis  of  socialist-feminist 
women's  unions  entails  examining 
the  internal  causal  ingredients  of  our 
present  situation.  These  fall  into  four 
categories:  (1)  theory,  (2)  practice,  (3) 
organizational  form,  and  (4)  internal 
process.  This  is  not  to  deny  the 
existence  of  external  factors  such  as 
the  present  political  and  economic 
climate,  but  rather  to  focus  for  pur- 
poses of  learning  on  internal  areas  — 
those  which  are  under  our  control. 

Theory 

The  increasing  emphasis  on  theory 
in  the  past  couple  of  years  appears  to 
us  to  be  a  positive  development. 
Women's  unions  and  individual 
women  have  counteracted  the  earlier 
anti-intellectualism  of  our  movement 
with  a  flurry  of  activity  focused  on 
integrating  analyses  of  race,  class  and 
sex,  and  on  defining  socialist- 
feminism.  However,  in  this  new 
emphasis  on  theory,  we  have  been 
excessively  impatient  for  finished 
products,  whole  answers  and  total 
theories,  and  have  not  allowed  for  the 
tremendous  amount  of  work  in- 
volved in  clearing  new  paths  and 
dealing  with  new  questions. 

An  additional  source  of  frustration 
is  that  our  theory  isn't  developing  in 
a  single  unified  direction;  there  is  no 
consensus  on  a  body  of  socialist- 
feminist  theorists,  and  there  is  no  list 
of  approved  official  theories.  The 
disagreement  about  whether  to  even 
use  the  word  "patriarchy"  in  our 
analysis,  let  alone  what  we  mean  by 
"patriarchy,"  is  a  case  in  point. 


Some  of  the  problems  we  have  had 
in  developing  a  theory  which  is  un- 
ique to  socialist-feminism  stem  from 
our  diverse  roots  in  the  women's 
movement  and  in  the  left.  To  give 
extreme  (but  real)  examples,  for  some 
women,  building  socialist-feminist 
theory  has  meant  totally  divorcing 
themselves  from  any  connections 
with  existing  Marxist  and  socialist 
theory;  for  others,  it  has  meant  mere- 
ly fitting  "the  woman  question"  into 
already  "proven"  socialist  theories. 
These  differences  in  approach  were 
visible  at  the  1975  National  Socialist 
Feminist  Conference  (in  Yellow 
Springs,  Ohio),  where  there  were 
women  who  insisted  that  our  analysis 
must  recognize  first  that  there  is  a 
primary  contradiction  which  defines 
and  divides  our  lives,  and  second, 
that  that  contradiction  is  class.  There 
were  other  women  who  saw  sex  as 
the  primary  contradiction.  But  for 
many  women,  socialist-feminism 
meant  developing  new  ways  of 
analyzing  things,  ways  which  don't 
necessarily  involve  a  single  primary 
contradiction,  where  it  is  not 
necessary  to  prioritize  people's  op- 
pression, and  where  the  focus  is  on 
understanding  the  interconnections 
among  capitalism,  patriarchy,  racism 
and  imperialism,  as  systems  of  op- 
pression. 

Frustrated  by  the  slow-moving 
process  of  building  new  theory  and 
by  the  lack  of  unified  direction  for 
that  theory,  some  members  of 
women's  unions  have  become  at- 
tracted to  groups  which  appear  to 
have  clearly  formulated  lines  on 
everything,  coherent  analyses  which 
seem  to  account  for  all  contradictions 
in  a  neat  package  —  for  instance, 
"Wages  for  Housework"  and  certain 


90/ Quest 


sectarian  Marxist-Leninist  groups. 
Our  expectations  were  to  quick-bake 
a  total  theory  from  scratch;  we 
berated  ourselves  for  failing  and 
sometimes  gave  up  too  soon. 

Finally,  another  frustration  often 
emerging  from  this  concentration  on 
rapid  theory-building  has  been  the 
neglect  of  practice.  Women's  union 
members  feel  pulled  between  both 
priorities,  wanting  to  complete 
working  papers  on  connections 
between  patriarchy  and  capitalism 
(theory),  and  also  aware  of  the  crucial 
importance  of  visible  practice,  now. 

Practice 

With  the  creation  of  women's  un- 
ions, many  of  us  established  demand- 
ing guidelines  for  practice  that  in- 
cluded dealing  with  issues  of  power 
and  attempting  to  integrate  our 
focuses  on  race,  class,  sex, 
lesbianism,  and  imperialism.  We 
developed  workgroups  when  most  of 
us  had  very  little  previous  experience 
in  doing  organizing  and  lots  of  high 
hopes.  We  soon  began  chastising 
ourselves  and  each  other  for  our  slow 
progress,  lack  of  visibility, 
questionable  target  groups,  narrow 
goals,  and  failures.  Our  impatience 
with  the  slow  process  of  developing 
theory  was  matched  with,  if  not  over- 
taken by,  our  high  expectations  for 
practice.  We  had  moved  beyond  the 
instant  gratification  of  earlier  service 
work;  its  replacement  —  slow  com- 
munity organizing  projects  and 
workplace  organizing  meetings  — 
wasn't  as  self-sustaining  as  we  had 
hoped. 

We  also  found  that  working  on 
one  area  of  oppression  —  one  issue  — 
didn't  satisfy  our  totalistic  perspec- 
tive.   Anti-imperalist    support 


workgroups  or  study  groups  didn't 
connect  with  community  organizing 
or  workplace-focused  groups; 
women  doing  community  organizing 
around  an  issue  such  as  health  or 
childcare  found  it  hard  to  integrate 
their  lesbian  politics  into  their 
organizing  work. 

And  too,  as  if  internal  questions  of 
success  were  not  enough  to  deal  with, 
successful  organizing  efforts  by 
socialist-feminists  often  became  the 
target  of  outside  groups  which 
attempted  to  infiltrate  and  take  over 
women's  unions. 

Organizational  Form 

Composition  of  membership  has 
always  been  a  source  of  tension 
within  the  women's  movement,  but 
the  more  explicit  goal  of  women's  un- 
ions —  to  deal  with  issues  of  race, 
class  and  sex  —  makes  us  more 
vulnerable  to  self-criticism  and 
criticism  by  others  that  we  are  a 
white,  middle-class  group.  We  have 
not  yet  found  effective  ways  of 
dealing  with  this  problem,  and  tend 
continually  to  resort  to  self-criticism 


Women's  Unions/91 


which  generates  guilt  rather  than 
change. 

Connected  with  the  issue  of  our 
membership  composition  have  been 
the  contradictory  pulls  of  desire,  on 
the  one  hand,  for  a  mass-based, 
multi-racial  women's  movement  and 
desire,  on  the  other,  for  a  highly 
defined  political  unity.  Our  priorities 
seesaw  between  building  up  a  more 
widely  representative  membership 
with  the  potential  for  providing  new 
perspectives,  new  energy  and  new 
morale,  and  simultaneously  feeling 
the  need  to  develop  our  politics  and 
visions  within  a  committed,  cohesive 
group. 

The  specific  structure  —  women's 
unions  with  autonomous 
workgroups  —  has  often  hindered  the 
development  of  either  a  unified 
theory  or  practice.  Each  group 
defines  its  own  focus  and  is  seldom 
monitored  by  the  entire  body.  Unions 
scattered  in  this  way  lack  a  base  of 
practice  from  which  comes  the 
required  commitment  for  working 
out  theory.  Fearing  the  pitfalls  of 
hierarchical  forms  and  democratic 
centralism,  we  created  unwieldy 
structures  for  decision-making  that 
often  discouraged  responsible 
leadership.     As     a     consequence, 


decisions  about  connections  with 
other  political  groups  such  as  NOW, 
or  work  around  the  ERA,  for  exam- 
ple, go  unresolved  due  to  the  absence 
of  effective  means  for  dealing  with 
differences  and  making  decisions. 

Internal  Process 

From  a  movement  past  char- 
acterized by  an  almost  total,  in- 
discrimate  love  for  our  sisters,  we 
arrive  in  1977  experiencing  divisions, 
differences,  anger  and  isolation  that 
cannot  help  but  generate  depression 
and  anger  turned  inward. 

Through  addressing  les- 
bian/straight differences,  socialist 
versus  feminist  priorities,  personal 
versus  political  needs  and  other 
issues,  we  have  not  only  dwindled  in 
numbers,  we  have  also  lost  touch 
with  that  sense  of  support  and 
women's  community  that  was  crucial 
to  building  the  current  women's 
movement. 

Members  of  women's  unions  find 
ourselves  dreading  rather  than  eager- 
ly anticipating  meetings.  We  have 
forgotten  that  women's  politics  used 
to  be  a  means  of  validation,  of  dis- 
covery, of  sharing  experiences. 
Though  our  meetings  may  now  be 
better   organized   than   formerly,   in 


92/Quest 


terms  of  having  an  agenda  and  a 
chair  and  criticism/self-criticism,  for 
example,  and  though  we  are  definite- 
ly not  suggesting  a  return  to  the 
"tyranny  of  structurelessness,"  the 
old  spirit  of  women  coming  together 
is  noticeably  absent. 

Socialist-feminist  women  are  tired 
of  internal  hassles  that  don't  get 
resolved  or  accepted;  tired  of  a  struc- 
ture that  no  longer  meets  personal  or 
political  needs.  We  are  impatient  for 
proof  of  success  in  theory  and  prac- 
tice, a  sign  that  an  autonomous 
women's  movement  is  a  viable 
strategy  for  revolution,  given  today's 
realities.  We  find  ourselves  once 
again  facing  a  dilemma  specific  to 
women:  "do  we  take  ourselves 
seriously?" 

Future  Direction 

In  analyzing  our  experiences,  we 
have  identified  three  themes  which 
give  us  a  handle  on  understanding 
the  survival  difficulties  of  women  s 
unions.  These  themes  suggest  possi- 
ble directions  for  us  to  take  at  this 
time.  First,  in  looking  at  the  history 
of  women's  unions,  we  recognize  that 
often  our  expectations  and  sense  of 
timing  have  been  off.  The  attempt  to 
somehow  meld  socialism  and 
feminism  into  something  new  and 
different  spoke  to  a  need  felt  by 
thousands  of  women  around  the 
country  in  the  early  '70's.  There  was 
a  sense  of  urgency  and  excitement, 
but  again  it  was  not  long  before  this 
energy  became  absorbed  in  dealing 
with  deficiencies.  The  fault  was  not 
with  the  concept;  rather,  we  wanted 
too  much,  too  soon  —  a  fully- 
developed  theory,  a  viable 
revolutionary  practice,  organizations 


with  strong  Third  World  and 
working  class  memberships  —  all 
right  away;  next  year  was  too  late.  In 
the  rush  of  enthusiasm  and  hope  that 
accompanied  the  creation  of  women's 
unions,  we  naively  set  ourselves  up 
to  do  the  impossible,  and  then  tore 
ourselves  apart  or  pulled  back  into 
isolation  when  we  failed. 

Secondly,  in  attempting  to  be  more 
"politically  focused,"  socialist- 
feminist  groups  lost  touch  with  their 
roots  in  the  mass  women's  move- 
ment. This  involved  a  shift  in 
priorities  away  from  meeting  per- 
sonal needs,  and  a  tendency  to  move 
farther  and  farther  away  from  the 
language  and  concerns  of  most 
women.  Our  groups  became  insular 
and  purist  as  we  searched  for  the  cor- 
rect political  line  and  form,  forgetting 
that  our  strengths  lay  in  our  feelings 
as  much  as  in  our  thoughts. 

A  third  overriding  theme  can  be 
described  as  socialist-feminism's 
attempt  to  be  everything  to  everyone. 
While  an  original  goal  of  socialist- 
feminist  unions  was  to  define  a 
specific  set  of  principles  of  unity,  it 
became  clear  by  the  1975  National 
Conference  that  socialist-feminist 
organizations,  as  well  as  the  concept 
of  socialist-feminism,  encompassed  a 
wide  range  of  tendencies  from 
lesbian-separatism  to  Marxist- 
Leninism.  Our  fears  of  alienating 
anyone  resulted  in  a  lowest-com- 
mon-denominator approach  to  con- 
flict and  decision-making.  And  as  is 
often  the  case  with  this  approach,  no 
one  was  satisfied. 

If  we  are  to  learn  from  past  mis- 
takes, our  future  goals  and  forms 
must  take  into  account  our  roots  in 
the  personal  needs  of  women,  and 
must  have  more  attainable  and  non- 


Women's  Unions/93 


apologetic,  clearly  defined  objectives. 
We  .would  like  to  suggest  the 
following  directions,  fully 
acknowledging  that  these  are  not 
total  answers:  (1)  single  focus  groups 
as  our  forms;  (2)  national  networks 
for  communication  and  education; 
(3)  reaffirming  our  own  roots  by  en- 
couraging women's  cultural  and 
social  activities  and  (4)  getting  in 
touch  with  the  mass  movement  for 
expansion. 

At  this  point,  it  seems  to  us  that 
unaffiliated,  single-focus  groups  may 
be  the  most  realistic  and  fertile  form 
for  socialist-feminist  political  work. 
We  envision  some  groups  focused  on 
study  or  theory  development,  and 
others  engaged  in  practice, 
organizing  around  a  specific  issue 
such  as  sterilization  abuse  or  violence 
against  women.  The  limited  size  of 
these  groups  makes  them  less  visible 
and  therefore  less  vulnerable  to  exter- 
nal attacks;  their  stated  focus  gives 
them  clearer  definition  and  makes 
them  less  prone  to  floundering. 
These  advantages  provide  the  oppor- 
tunity to  develop  the  theory  and 
practice  of  socialist-feminism 
without  getting  swallowed  up  or 
drained  by  the  kinds  of  tensions  that 
plagued  women's  unions.  This  is  not 
a  new  idea;  many  study  and  single 
issue  groups  already  exist  and  are 
beginning.  Rather,  what  seems  im- 
portant is  the  deliberate  assessment 
of  this  form  as  most  appropriate  for 
these  times. 

In  encouraging  the  development  of 
groups  which  may  choose  to  do  only 
theory,  we  are  aware  that  (particular- 
ly in  academic  communities),  theory- 
building  may  take  place  in  complete 
isolation  from  practice  and  the  real 
world.  We  feel  it  is  crucial  to  work 


consciously  to  understand  and  fight 
the  pitfalls  of  specialization  —  to  keep 
our  theory  builders  from  turning 
elitist  and  to  keep  our  theory  from 
becoming  abstract.  And  clearly,  it  is 
crucial  that  our  practice  not  lose  its 
base  in  theory. 

Our  vision  for  the  future  of  the 
single  focus  group  is  that  it  would 
ideally  become  a  small,  long-term, 
tight  political  unit  where  women 
would  not  only  develop  political 
theory  and  practice,  but  also  provide 
the  kinds  of  support  and  personal 
ties  which  integrate  new  and  old 
movement  members.  We  would 
expect  (and  we  project)  that  these 
small  groups  eventually  will  become 
a  network  of  local  groups  and 
hopefully,  a  national  movement  at 
such  time  as  we  are  more  willing  to 
commit  ourselves  to  particular  com- 
munities and  political  groupings. 

One  of  the  values  of  the  form  of  a 
women's  union  is  that,  within  a 
single  organization,  theory  and  prac- 
tice can  develop  in  close  proximity. 
With  the  increasing  dissolution  of 
this  form  and  the  growth  of  smaller 
single-focus  groups,  we  feel  it  is  of 
greater  importance  than  ever  for 
socialist-feminists  to  build  national 
networks  of  communications  and 
sharing.  These  would  serve  many 
purposes:  they  would  fight  feelings 
of  isolation  experienced  by  many 
groups,  further  debate  around  crucial 
issues,  and  serve  to  integrate  theory 
and  practice.  We  will  have  to  create 
new  mechanisms  for  building  this 
much-needed  communication,  as  well 
as  commit  ourselves  to  using  already 
existing  vehicles,  such  as  Quest  and 
Off  Our  Backs. 

In  moving  to  define  ourselves  as 
socialist-feminists    and    to    build 


94/Quest 


women's  unions,  we  have  lost  touch 
with  many  of  our  values  and 
strengths.  We  must  commit  ourselves 
anew  to  regaining  these  lost  values; 
to  allowing  ourselves  to  deal  with  our 
personal  needs;  and  to  relocating 
ourselves  within  the  women's  move- 
ment and  the  women's  community. 
We  need  to  affirm  our  belief  in  the 
significance  of  our  personal  lives  by 
once  again  making  social  and  cultural 
contact  among  women  a  priority.  We 
need  to  create  positive  forms  by 
which  women  with  differences  can 
share  not  only  points  of  view  but  also 
the  underlying  bonds  of  women's 
experience.  Thus  we  need  to  support 
women's  dances,  women's 
restaurants,  women's  music, 
women's  discussion  groups  and  other 
feminist  endeavours  as  ways  of 
bringing  women  together. 

We  who  define  ourselves  as 
socialist-feminists  must  find  ways  to 
connect  with  the  mass  or  popularized 
women's  movement.  We  have 
written  off  much  of  that  movement 
as  "bourgeois  feminism"  and  "refor- 
mism", but  while  we  have  argued 
with  each  other  about  the  correct 
strategy  for  organizing  working-class 
women,  more  and  more  of  these 
women    have    joined    groups    like 


NOW.  These  groups  have  been 
moving  toward  a  more  radical 
analysis.  And  the  importance  of 
working  with  these  women  and 
groups  becomes  even  clearer  when 
we  look  at  the  current  erosion  of 
gains  made  in  the  areas  of  abortion, 
pregnancy  leave,  welfare,  and 
employment  opportunities.  Social- 
ist-feminists need  to  take  a  look,  in 
their  own  locales,  at  the  possibilities 
of  relating  to  other  women's  groups 
such  as  NOW,  CLUW,  League  of 
Women  Voters,  YWCA,  and  PTA, 
either  in  broad-based  coalition,  or 
around  specific  issues. 

While  we  strive  to  communicate 
with  large  numbers  of  women,  we 
must  reject  our  tendency  to  be  all 
things  to  all  people,  and  commit 
ourselves  instead  to  analyses  we  find 
valid.  This  implies  accepting  that 
socialist-feminism  may  no  longer  be  a 
catch-all,  that  it  will  alienate  some 
women,  but  in  the  long  run,  that  it 
will  move  us  beyond  divisions  to  that 
unified  clarity  of  vision  necessary  to 
a  serious  movement. 

The  problem  and  challenges  facing 
socialist-feminists  do  not  exist  in  a 
void,  nor  are  they  unique  to  the 
women's  movement.  We  are  trying  to 
build  a  new  theory  and  practice  at  a 


Women's  Unions/95 


time  of  political  and  economic 
hardship,  when  all  progressive  peo- 
ple are  struggling  with  issues  of 
apathy,  appropriate  organizational 
form,  and  means  for  integrating 
theory  and  practice  —  to  mention 
only  a  few  universal  issues.  Socialist- 
feminists  need  to  recognize  the 
necessarily  experimental  nature  of 
these  times.  We  must  allow  ourselves 
to  take  the  time  and  space  necessary 
to  develop  our  theory,  our  practice 
and  our  organizational  forms.  We 
must  not  retreat  to  the  way  things 
were,  to  the  forms  that  worked  and 
felt  good  in  1969,  or  1973;  we  have  to 
take  stock  and  look  backwards  only 
long  enough  to  gain  historical 
perspective  and  see  where  the  cycles 
of  change  have  brought  us.  We  are 
dealing  with  hard  questions  —  what 
are  the  viable  strategies  and 
organizational  forms  for  these  times? 
How  do  we  incorporate  our  learning 
from  the  past  and  the  ideas  of  others 
into  our  understandings  of  our  lives 
today  and  our  visions  of  the  future? 
—  and  we  must  not  expect  instant 
success  or  easy  answers.  The  reality  of 
1977  is  that  only  those  who  are  com- 
mitted to  a  clear  vision  of 
revolutionary  change  and  are  able  to 
settle  in  for  the  long  haul  will  be  able 
to  survive.  As  women,  with  such  a 
newly-developed  vision  and  sense  of 
ourselves,  we  are  doubly  challenged.

96/Quest 


Notes  About  Writing 


We  have  often  been  told  that  Quest  is  abstract  or  "too  hard  to  read." 
We  seek  concrete  suggestions  on  how  to  present  political  analysis  (which 
is  never  going  to  be  "easy  reading"),  more  clearly.  We  try  to  provide  a 
balance  of  different  styles  of  writing  in  each  issue,  but  often  we  do  not  re- 
ceive enough  variety  in  the  manuscripts  you  submit.  Our  goal  in  editing 
is  clarity;  whatever  the  author  is  saying,  we  work  to  make  it  as  clear  as 
possible. 

For  most  of  us,  our  writing  reflects  our  education.  We  were  trained,  if 
at  all,  to  write  "essays"  and  "papers."  It  has  been  suggested  that  women 
who  write  for  Quest  might  experiment  with  a  more  journalistic  style.  We 
don't  know  how  well  it  works  to  use  this  style  for  political  analysis,  but 
we  welcome  such  efforts.  Some  examples  that  might  be  useful  models  are 
articles  in  The  Progressive,  Social  Policy,  or  The  New  Republic. 

We  would  also  like  to  print  more  interviews,  and  we  encourage  you  to 
submit  them.  Another  suggestion  is  taping  a  discussion  and  making  that 
into  an  article.  Much  of  our  history  is  not  recorded  because  activists  sel- 
dom take  time  to  write.  But  it  is  important  to  exchange  our  stories,  our 
growth,  and  our  understanding.  We  would  like  to  create  new  ways  to 
share  this  learning,  since,  though  much  of  our  verbal  dialog  is  our  best 
analysis,  it  never  gets  on  paper. 

For  each  issue,  we  send  out  mailings  and  announcements  to  as  many 
women  as  possible  to  encourage  submissions  to  Quest.  We  also  intend 
the  back  cover  blurbs  as  an  open  invitation  for  articles.  Writing  is  not 
easy  for  any  of  us.  Our  challenge,  as  feminists,  is  to  find  new  ways  to  ex- 
press our  experiences  and  our  analysis  so  that  they  aid  us  better  in  chang- 
ing society. 


Articles  should  be  double  spaced  and  submitted  in  duplicate  (original 
plus  one  copy).  Length  of  submissions  should  be  from  2,500  words  (10 
typewritten  pages)  for  reviews,  responses,  and  short  articles,  to,  at  most, 
7,500  words  (25  pages)  for  longer  articles.  Where  appropriate,  biblio- 
graphic footnotes  should  be  typed  at  the  end  of  the  article.  All 
manuscripts,  poems,  and  graphics  should  be  original,  unpublished  ma- 
terial and  must  be  accompanied  by  a  stamped  self-addressed  envelope. 


Future  Issues 

INTERNATIONAL 

Fall,  1977  Vol.  IV,  No.  2 

Advances  for  women  demand  that  our  analysis  and  strategies  be 
drawn  from  different  angles,  from  different  cultural  and  national 
settings.  This  issue  will  be  devoted  to  international  perspectives  and 
articles  with  a  focus  on  varying  feminist  concerns  and  activities,  the- 
oretical and  programmatic  developments,  and  how  these  are  affected 
by  different  socio-economic  and  governmental  factors.

THE  BODY  POLITIC 

Winter,  1977-78  Vol.  IV,  No.  3 

Our  bodies — how  we  use,  view,  and  treat  them — are  basic  to  our 
vision.  We  want  this  issue  to  explore  body  politics  in  its  broadest 
sense,  through  articles  that  discuss:  the  body  industry,  from  birth  to 
death;  feminist  and  environmental  politics;  the  future  of  reproduc- 
tion, and  its  effect  on  the  female  nature;  dying;  age,  class,  and  body 
perspectives;  health  services  and  insurance  and  the  politics  of  geno-

WOMEN  IN  THEIR  COMMUNITIES 
Spring,  1978  Vol.  IV,  No.  4 

A  critical  aspect  of  community  is  affinity  or  identification.  A  com- 
munity is  a  group  of  people  who  share  something.  Some  of  the 
things  shared  are  common  place,  common  work,  and/or  common 
perception.  This  issue  will  explore  how  we  define  our  communities; 
how  they  develop  and  interact;  how  well  they  serve  women  working 
on  common  goals,  and  how  we  relate  as  individual  women  within 
them.  Copy  Deadline:  September,  30,   197  7

Are  we  connecting  our  lives  to  our  ideas?  This  issue  will  be  an  open 
forum  for  substantive  responses  to  our  first  three  years  of  publication 
and  for  your  input  to  help  chart  our  future.  We  seek  discussion  of  topics
